    "section": "The Young Man’s Problem",
    "text": "The Young Man’s Problem\nIn order to make a story out of this, I want make a Protagonist out the young man in the ad. It is he who has the problem and he who is going to apply TRIZ to solve it. I discuss the source of his Problem and give an analysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including the formulation of the Contradiction, Identification of Causes, the statement of the Ideal Final Result, and finally using the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix to find Inventive Principles, that lead to the solution, which of course, is meant to unerringly include Spotify !\nFirst a philosophical digression:—\nSeveral authors have taken a Game View of life. James P Carse’s famous book titled Finite and Infinite Games speaks of Play, Types of Games, Rules, Winning and our own aims in the Game itself. A similar articulation is, in my opinion, that of Mihaly Csikszentlmihalyi in his concept of Flow, shown here below:\n\n\nFrom Sketchplanations\n\nWhen the Game presents very little Challenge, we are bored. When the Game demands extreme skills the challenge is too much for us and we experience anxiety. When the Challenge presented is just barely matched by our Skill, we are in the zone of Flow, or what I call Play.\nA good metaphoric image for this experience is as follows:— that we live in a space where the Floor of Boredom is always rising and would crush us against our Ceiling of Anxiety. One Way to deal with this is to develop more Skills and push the Ceiling away, effectively moving into the zone of Flow. Another Way of looking at this is what Carse suggests: When Play is no longer possible, change the Game.\nSo what does all this have to do with getting veggies?\nThe ad is, in my opinion, all about Boredom, and how to avoid it. And not offend anybody. The Young Man (hereinafter, “YM”) simply has to accompany his Mom, and be there while she gets the veggies. I will exaggerate his irritation and his boredom at the risk of offending young people likely to read this, and say that he would rather not be there but he does not want to hurt Mom.\nWe are now ready for the TRIZ based Analysis of this Problem!",

    "section": "A TRIZ Analysis of a Visit to the Subzi Mandi",
    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of a Visit to the Subzi Mandi\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation and see how turning these could lead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning the knobs/parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if the YM goes to the market with Mom, he would most likely get bored, but would please Mom. If he doesn’t go, then he chills at home, but Mom is going to justifiably furious. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdministrative Contradiction\n\n\n\nThe YM wants to chill at home but Mom wants him to take her veggie shopping. He has to put up with the Waste of Time, and being bored, and Stress at being away from friends.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIdeal Final Result\n\n\n\nThe YM must go to the Market and not be bored.\n\n\nNote again the impossible sounding way of expressing the IFR! One needs practice, like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, who could think of Six Impossible Things before Breakfast ! Also note there could be other ways of specifying the IFR. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze each Contradiction both ways1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTC 1\n\n\n\nImprove Loss of Time (26) and not worsen Effect of External Harmful Factors (30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTC 2\n\n\n\nImprove Increase Productivity (44) and not worsen Stress (19)\n\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that while going to the Market may be unavoidable, Boredom need not ensue. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Noise(29) as the “metaphoric thing” to avoid, but the current IFR doesn’t quite support that. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhysical Contradiction\n\n\n\nThe YM must be in the market and not be in the market at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed squarely at one of the Assumptions in the Problem, that the YM simply has to go. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC.

Play Music !!🔉 🤣\n\n14(Spheroidality): Wear “spherical” headphones!!🎧! Create a “sound sphere”!

The rest are perhaps (at least to me!) not very evocative, unless 37(Thermal Expansion) means “throw a temper tantrum at Mom”? Never!\nSo there you have it! The Cinderella song played on Spotify becomes not just a noise canceller but actually seems to substitute the very conversation between Mom and the vendor. And the YM has successfully attained Flow !

    "text": "Rivers of Plastic\nAccording to Our World in Data:\nPrevious research suggested that only a handful of rivers transports almost all of the plastic to the sea – new research suggests this is not the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Rivers of Plastic\n\n\n\n\n\n80% of the world’s ocean plastics enter the ocean via rivers and coastlines. The other 20% come from marine sources such as fishing nets, ropes, and fleets. To tackle plastic pollution we need to know where these plastics are coming from. Previous studies suggested that a very small number of rivers were responsible for the vast majority of ocean plastics: 60% to 90% of plastics came from only ten rivers.\nHigher-resolution mapping and consideration for factors such as climate, terrain, land use, and distance to the ocean suggests that many smaller rivers play a bigger role than we thought. It takes 1,600 of the biggest emitting rivers to account for 80% of plastic inputs to the ocean.\nIt is estimated that 81% of ocean plastics come from Asian rivers. The Philippines alone contribute around one-third of the global total. Since the number of contributing rivers is much higher than previously thought, we will need global efforts to improve waste management and plastic collection rather than targeting only a few of the largest rivers.\nThe latest research, which was just published in Science Advances, updates our understanding of how these plastics are distributed.1 Lourens Meijer et al. (2021) developed higher-resolution modeling of global riverine plastics. They found that rivers emitted around 1 million tonnes of plastics into the oceans in 2015 (with an uncertainty ranging from 0.8 to 2.7 million tonnes). Around one-third of the 100,000 river outlets that they modeled contributed to this. The other two-thirds emitted almost no plastic to the ocean. It’s an important point because we might think that most, if not all, rivers are contributing to the problem. This is not the case.\nBut, importantly, the latest research suggests that smaller rivers play a much larger role than previously thought. In the chart we see the comparison of the latest research (in red) with the two earlier studies which mapped global riverine inputs. This chart shows how many of the top-emitting rivers (on the x-axis) make up a given percentage of plastic inputs (y-axis). Note that the number of rivers on the x-axis is given on a logarithmic scale.[emphasis mine]\n\nSo the problem is more widespread at source and therefore distributed local solutions are needed.",

    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Amsterdam Bubble Barrier\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\n\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation\nWe see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement / Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nRe-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive Principles.\nApply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: TRIZ Method\n\n\n\n\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Ishikawa Diagram for Plastics in the Water\n\n\n\n\nEach of the above terms in the Ishikawa can be a knob for us. Turning the knobs/parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram, we try to improve a certain Parameter or we try to reduce its effect. In doing so we could construct several alternative Problem Descriptions. ( Of course not all Parameters may be accessible in a given situation )\n\nWe want to deal with the (hopefully) smaller quantities of plastic closer to source, rather than the much larger quantities as we get nearer and into the high seas.\nClearly we want the rivers to flow and give us our sense of beauty, serenity and movement, and poetry, but the same flow should not transport plastics downstream.\nWe also want the plastic, if we can stop it from floating onward, to be “accessible” and be easily gathered from the stream.\nSo a simple dam or weir-like structure, or a net could work, but would possibly ruin our sense of beauty. For example, we could consider stopping the flow of water in places with weirs, but then that could make the location ugly and be a hindrance to recreation and transportation. The presence of plastics in the water could also alter the colour of the water.\nFinally, we are interested in preserving dissolved oxygen in the water. We want to prevent other organic decaying material accumulating around the plastic and increasing the Biological Oxygen Demand Not to mention the smell.\n\nSo many problems !!\nWith all this discussion, we can state at least one of our Problems as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdministrative Contradiction\n\n\n\nAC: We wish to pull out plastics from the river without interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational / transportation )\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIdeal Final Result\n\n\n\nIFR: The River must flow. The Plastics must not.\n\n\nShort and pithy.\nWe could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our focus was. (Our focus here is the river). The way we would look at the Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case. More on this in just a bit!\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTechnical Contradictions\n\n\n\n\n\nTC 1: Increase Volume of Stationary Object(8) and not worsen Harmful effects acting on the system(40)\n\nTC 2: Improve Harmful effects acting on the system(40) and not worsen Volume of Stationary Object(8)\n\n\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects that we choose the make the river our focus. We want to increase the volume of the stationary plastic in the river, while not worsening the harmful effects acting on the river. Note how the IFR is included here, in using the word stationary for the object: the plastic must not flow, while the river must.\nAs stated in my previous articles, there is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, using the language of TRIZ, the 48 Parameters in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Amount of Substance (10) i.e. the plastic on the river, as the “metaphoric thing” to improve but the current IFR speaks of the river. Or we could choose Aesthetics and Appearance (39) as our target, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed manner. TRIZ tends to focus our attention like no other method that I know of.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhysical Contradiction\n\n\n\nPC: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC.",

Let us apply some these Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions we try to map these back into the Problem at hand:\n\n\n(39)Inert Atmosphere: Hmm…what can be inert in the River? What could “inert” mean here? The River should be inert…so must not flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!\n\n24(Intermediary): OK, something between the River and the Plastic. But…we don’t want nets or dams or weirs…then what? Need to think!!\n\n19(Periodic Action): What can be “periodic” in the River? Waves? But how do we make waves? Need to think some more!!\n\n27(Cheap Short Living Objects): What can be cheap short and short living in the River water? Not fish, surely…wait, BUBBLES!!!\n\nSo, breathlessly: we create bubbles in the water and use them as an Intermediary to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we want it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both Inert and Atmosphere, literally! And they are Cheap and Short-Lived so we need to regenerate them Periodically! We can periodically sweep the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb any other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!\n5(Merging) is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect. 17(Another Dimension) is also evocative and powerful as a Solution: the River flows horizontally but the barrier we need to create is vertical. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles dissolve in the River water (assuming another dimension, as it were) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains do!!\nSo there you have it! It seems that Going Dutch even with bubbles, is a good idea !",

    "text": "Using TRIZ Separation Principles\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying physical parameter, such as length, breadth, weight, or energy, or speed for example that lies at the root of our Technical Contradiction.\nOur IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to flow at the same time. But the Plastics are in the River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!\nCan we make the River “less of a River” in places? Can we make separate zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to harvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as (39)Inert Atmosphere and 24(Intermediary) suggest such a “spatial” separation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a Physical Contradiction related to “time”. TRIZ offers us a smaller and more easily “memorizable” set of metaphoric solutions in the form of Separation Principles. Here they are:\n\nSeparation in Time\nSeparation in Space\nSeparation on Condition\nSeparation between Parts and the Whole\n\nNote that while these Separation Principles are just a handful to memorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway. But then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles in the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew to a particular kind of Separation Principle.\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ, please send me a DM!

The Road is a linear thing and has length and breadth. What would we use for another dimension? Height, of course! So, we need to go either above the road or below! And that leads us to a …bridge and a tunnel !!!\n\nThe other Inventive Principles are, to me, not evocative enough in this instance. But we already have a decent idea: we could just imagine a set of Local bridges and tunnels that occur at Periodic Intervals along the highway. And that is exactly what Parks Canada have done.\n\nHere is the solution in action:",

Our IFR states that we want the humans and animals to use the road at the same TIME, and hence Separation in Space becomes a nice way to think of a solution.\nThat’s a wrap! In the next episode of the #TRIZ Chronicles, I wish to step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR!

Childhood Games will be examined to understand the aspects of Play and linked to and the idea of “Infinite Games” by James Carse and how Rule-Breaking in Play is an important step in enhancing personal creativity.\nBourdieu’s concept of Cultural Capital will be interpreted as one of the primary sources for an individual’s ideas, along with Csikzentmihalyi’s idea of the Creative Domain, Field and the Creative Individual. Tools for enhancing Cultural Capital will be introduced. The MBTI / Big 5 Tool will be used to understanding ourselves, our abilities, strengths, traits and differences from others.\nStructured heuristic techniques based on de Bono’s 6 Hat method will help us see how to perform Situational Analysis and Idea Generation, to help us take ideas from conception to execution. Reference will be made to Alex Osborn’s “Applied Imagination” methods and tied to the Big 5 results.\nAspects of the Systematic Russian Process of innovation and problem solving, TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskhikh Zadatch) invented by Genrikh Altshuller will be introduced. Alshuller’s idea of Generalized Problem Solving by borrowing ideas/memes from other Domains, his 8 Laws of Evolution of Products, and ( a few of ) the 40 Inventive Principles derived from his analysis of patents, will be covered in gamified fashion. These will be linked to with David Perkin’s (Harvard Project Zero) ideas and Edward de Bono’s methods to interpret, and design for, existing situations and products.\nAdvanced aspects of TRIZ such as Su-Field Analysis, the Laws of Product Evolution, and ARIZ will be introduced in gamefied fashion.\nField visits to product, food preparation, solar energy, and logistics companies will be used to bolster and demonstrate the unity of these concepts acquired in class. Technological assignments, and non-tech making and presenting tasks will also be used in class to create gamefied experiences for all of these.\nThe students will finally use the methods and ideas they have learnt and apply them in creating a project, artifact or performance of their own.",

What is this new(?)-fangled structured TRIZ process thing?\nLet us see some short extracts from Herbert Simon’s landmark book, Sciences of the Artificial: (emphasis everywhere in the following is mine)\n\nChapter 5: The Science of Design: Creating the Artificial Historically and traditionally, it has been the task of the science disciplines to teach about natural things: how they are and how they work. It has been the task of engineering schools to teach about artificial things: how to make artifacts that have desired properties and how to design.\n\n\nEngineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design.\n\n\nIn view of the key role of design in professional activity, it is ironic that in this century the natural sciences almost drove the sciences of the artificial from professional school curricula, a development that peaked about two or three decades after the Second World War. Engineering schools gradually became schools of physics and mathematics; medical school became schools of biological science; business schools became schools of finite mathematics.\n\n\nSuch a universal phenomenon must have had a basic cause. It did have a very obvious one. As professional schools, including the independent engineering schools, were more and more absorbed into the general cul- ture of the university, they hankered after academic respectability.\n\n\nIn terms of the prevailing norms, academic respectability calls for subject matter that is intellectually tough, analytic, formalizable, and teachable.\n\n\nIn the past much, if not most, of what we knew about design and about the artificial sciences was intellectually soft, intuitive, informal, and cookbooky.\n\nYeah. That’s why this course exists. To make Design tough, analytic, formalizable, and teachable learnable.",

What did you think of immediately when you saw the first picture on this page?\nIn TRIZ, the fundamental way of looking at an Inventive Design Problem is to discover and propose Contradictions. These are rendered in as simple and stark a language as possible…the starker the better!\nOnce we have our Contradiction (and there can be more than one in a given Design Situation !) we can use TRIZ Principles to solve them WITHOUT COMPROMISE.\nWhat sort of Contradictions do we see in these familiar objects? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?",

What is its Main Purpose?\nACCOMPANYING: What are the other Accompanying Objects that it works with?\nKNOBS: What is One Aspect, or Parameter, or Knob for each of the Objects that you have listed, that makes the Object useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTING: What are the current Settings/Values for each Knob?\nMEDDLE: Change the Setting of Each Knob to its natural opposite extreme. What Happens? Is it a good thing? When?\nYou will see that in many cases, each Knob creates a Certain Outcome at one Setting and another Outcome at the Opposite Setting.\nAre both Outcomes desirable? Do you want “eat your cake and have it too?”\nThis could be the source of your PROBLEM / CONTRADICTION !!\n\nIn TRIZ, this way of expressing a Problem as a simple Contradiction is referred to as stating an ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC). (Oh those Russians…).\nLater we will use our experience with making metaphors to convert the AC into a more TRIZ-like Contradiction, using TRIZ language.\nLet us now consider some examples first and then get some practice at setting up simple AC:",

    "section": "The History of TRIZ",
    "text": "The History of TRIZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creator of TRIZ, Genrich Altshuller, was born in Russia in 1926, made his first invention at age 14 (9th Grade), and was later educated as a mechanical engineer. At the time he started working on TRIZ, in 1946, he was employed in the patent department of the Soviet navy, assisting inventors in filing their patents, in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nWhile there he became intrigued by the question of how an invention happens:\n\nIs it a matter of luck? The result of a mental “light bulb” turning on, as in the comics? Or can inventions be seen as the result of systematic patterns of inventive thinking?\n\nAltshuller adopted an empirical approach to answering this question. He studied thousands of patents, looking for commonalities, repetitive patterns, and principles of inventive thought. As he found them he codified and documented them, as shown below. His results, when eventually published, attracted many enthusiasts who continued and expanded the work over the years, reviewing what is now estimated to be more than two million patents worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1: Apparent Solution. This level requires no real invention; it consists of minor adaptations of existing concepts. Simple improvement of a technical system. They require knowledge available within an industry relevant to that system.\nLevel 2: Improvement. This level makes small improvements to existing approaches. Inventions include the resolution of a technical contradiction(TC). They require knowledge from different areas within an industry relevant to the system.\nLevel 3: Invention Inside the Paradigm. This level uses methods from other fields and improves previous approaches. This is an invention containing a resolution of a physical contradiction(PC). It requires knowledge from other industries.\nLevels #2 & #3 solve contradictions and therefore are innovative by definition.\nLevel 4. Invention Outside the Paradigm. This level involves a new design that is based on modifications of existing principles but in a manner not previously used. This level involves development a new technology. It is developed by using breakthrough solutions that requires knowledge from different fields of science. This fourth level also improves upon a technical system, but without solving an existing technical problem. Instead, it improves the function by replacing the original technology with a new technology. For example a mechanical system is replaced with a chemical system to perform the function.\nLevel 5: Discovery. This is the highest invention level. It consists of completely new concepts using new principles, and involves the discovery of new phenomena. The new phenomenon is discovered that allows pushing the existing technology to a higher level.\nAltshuller concluded from his research that a large number of patents (77%) belong only to Levels #1 and #2. The practical utilization of TRIZ methodology can help inventors elevate their innovative solutions to Levels #3 and #4. As a result of this work, hundreds of technical papers and many books on TRIZ have been published, including 14 books by Altshuller himself.\nTRIZ is actively used in Companies such as Boeing, Bridgestone, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor Company, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Hewlett-Packard, Illinois Tool Works, Inficon, Ingersoll Rand, Kimberly-Clark, L.G. Electronics, Lucent Technologies, Michelin, National Semiconductor, NASA, Philips, Rolls-Royce, Samsung, Siemens, Western Digital, and Xerox among others.",

    "text": "Speaking TRIZ\nAltshuller made two more discoveries (at least!) based on his study of Soviet Patents:\n\nThat when the the problems solved in the patents were expressed as Contradictions, there were only a few standard phrases using which these Contradictions could be constructed. These were an astonishingly small 48 in number!! Every problem could be described as a contradiction using some pair of these 48 parameters. We will call these the 48 TRIZ Parameters1.\nWhen the solutions in the Patents were examined, they could all be expressed simply as one of 40 abstract nouns or phrases. Just…40! We will call these the 40 TRIZ Inventive Principles\n\nSome examples:\n\nTRIZ Parameters: Weight of an stationary Object, Loss of Substance, and Temperature.\n\nTRIZ Inventive Principles: Asymmetry, Parameter Change and The Other Way Around.\n\nSo the task is:\n\nTake your Administrative Contradiction (AC)\n\nConvert “each side” (i.e terms) of the AC into a TRIZ Technical Contradiction by using a pair of the 48 TRIZ Parameters.\n\nMake sure that you are able to justify to yourself the metaphorical connection between the terms of AC and the chosen pair of TRIZ Parameters. For example, “Loss of substance” could mean “loss of money”!! Write this down, for both sides of your AC.\n\nWe may be able to also create a Physical Contradiction at this time, when we are examining the Ishikawa knobs.",

    "section": "Some Contradiction Examples",
    "text": "Some Contradiction Examples\nTC Examples:\n\nIncreasing the power of an engine (positive improvement) requires an increase in the size of the engine (negative effect). So, an inventor considers increasing the power partially in order to reduce the negative effect (compromise solution).\n\nTo increase the speed of an airplane, a new and more powerful engine is installed. This increases the weight of the airplane so the wings can no longer support it during takeoff. Increasing the wing size produces more drag, slowing the airplane down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee this:\n\n\nPC Examples\n\nLanding gear must be present on an airplane in order to land and takeoff. It should not be present during flight because of an increase in air drag. The physical contradiction is that the landing gear must be both present and absent. This contradiction is resolved by separating the requirements in time — make the landing gear retractable.\nFor high water diving, water must be “hard” to support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the diver. The physical contradiction: The water must be hard and soft at the same time. This contradiction is resolved by separating the requirements in space: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the pool contains both air and water.\n… an inherent contradiction in takeout pizza products. The customer wants the pizza to be hot, but hot pizza gives off steam. As a result, the cardboard box lid absorbs the steam, softens, and collapses down on the pizza. When the customer lifts the lid of the pizza box after arriving home, some of the pizza, which has stuck to the lid, attaches to the raised lid and the customer is not pleased because a significant amount of the cheese that he paid for is not edible. We want the pizza to be hot for one reason (an enjoyable pizza) and we want it to be cold for another (preventing the lid from becoming soggy and collapsing due to steam and water absorption). The little plastic tripod that is in the center of many takeout pizzas was the subject of the talk I heard. Such a simple invention! It resolves the contradiction of the pizza being hot and cold at the same time. (Jack Hipple, The Ideal Result)",

    "text": "Thinking, Problem Solving, and Language\nHere is Albert Einstein speaking on The Language of Science. The transcript is here.PDF.\nOne quote from this short reading seems very apposite here:\n\n“The super-national character of scientific concepts and scientific language is due to the fact that they have been set up by the best brains of all countries and all times. In solitude, and yet in cooperative effort as regards the final effect, they created the spiritual tools for the technical revolutions which have transformed the life of mankind in the last centuries. Their system of concepts has served as a guide in the bewildering chaos of perceptions so that we learned to grasp general truths from particular observations.”",

    "text": "Substance Field Analysis: Collisions between Worlds\nRecall that the TRIZ Inventive Principles are metaphoric and we need to bring them down to earth and realise the fruit of our labours. This, as we discussed, is a leveraging of Cultural Capital from previous and current generations of inventors, of dipping into the distilled wisdom of the human race. Altshuller seems to have anticipated the difficulty here: we may not have the encyclopaediac knowledge of scientific solutions from many other domains, where the same problem as the one at hand (metaphorically) manifested itself.\nHence he also documented 76 Scientific Solutions, or effects that are related to solving Contradictions. In order to facilitate that relationship, he also proposed a much-used scientific TRIZ Method, Substance-Field, or Su-Field, Analysis. We will now acquire this TRIZ method to complete our TRIZ Toolkit.",

    "text": "Game #1\nThis game idea is the result of a chance conversation in class with student Ira Patil, FSP 2022.\nThings you need:\n\nMakey-Makey ( one per group )\nLaptop\nAn App or a Game on the laptop (“Inner Game”)\nSome board game with pieces. Can use a non-board game also. (“Outer Game”)\nPaper and pencil/graphite pieces\nClassroom Furniture\nCellophane tape to anchor “contact areas”. (See below)\n\nGood to have:\n\nAdditional Wire, metal foil, metal scales, keys, coins, spoons, and miscellaneous small light metallic items if you can get them\n\nInstructions:\n\nConnect your Makey-Makey to the laptop over USB\nFire up a the chosen “inner game” app on the laptop. Ensure that the game uses UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/CLICK to make things happen. E.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCnGTnr7eqQ. A not-too-violent arcade or RPG is also ok.\nSet up your board / non-board outer game close by.\nConnect the GND and the 5 other signals from your Makey-Makey to a variety of objects, both living and non-living, from your board game.\nIf you are using a non-board “outer game”, which involves only human movement, then ensure that the floor or wall has contact areas to each of the 5 signals. These can be made, for example, with a paper stuck to the wall, a metal foil stuck on the paper itself, with a wire extended from there to the Makey-Makey.\nPlay both games simultaneously. This is related to Arthur Koestler’s idea of a bisociation 1, where we experience a collision between two frames of reference.\n\nQuestions to contemplate:\n\nDoes the competitive aspect of the external game allow itself to be included in the inner game?\nDoes the inner game influence movements, strategies, and plays in the outer game?\nCan other senses (hearing, for example), be included in the game(s) in a hitherto unknown way?\nCan the normal use of senses within the game ( e.g. sight, of course) be altered?\nWhat other parameters and forces can you include in this collision between two Game-Worlds?\nOpinions: Was some interaction between the two Games undesirable? Were others highly desirable? Describe these.",

Please enter your answer at the appropriate location.\nIntepretation\nThe Marvels of Priming\nAs is common in science, the first big breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.\nPriming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant table, you will be primed for wobbly as well. Furthermore, the primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of associated ideas. The mapping of these ripples is now one of the most exciting pursuits in psychological research.\nThe Ideomotor Effect Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.\nIn an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University — most aged eighteen to twentytwo — to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others.\nReferences for Further Reading"

Keeping in mind the potentially harmful consequences of first impressions is helpful when meeting new people.\n\n\nSlow down: The second step is to deliberately slow down your judgement and any subsequent decisions. For example, never make a recruitment choice straight after the interview.\n\n\nBe systematic: Finally, try to engage your analytical reasoning skills by taking a systematic approach. This sounds trickier than it is. In the context of interviewing, you could prepare a list of essential criteria and force yourself to consider each one carefully before making a choice.\n\nThis helps us to not arrive at flawed ideas to pursue but ones that we are reasonably sure we can justify to….our Field, as conceptualized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi."

Please enter your answer at the appropriate location.\nIntepretation\nThe Marvels of Priming\nAs is common in science, the first big breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.\nPriming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant table, you will be primed for wobbly as well. Furthermore, the primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of associated ideas. The mapping of these ripples is now one of the most exciting pursuits in psychological research.\nThe Ideomotor Effect Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.\nIn an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University — most aged eighteen to twentytwo — to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others.\nReferences for Further Reading\nTBF!",

    "text": "The Creativity Systems Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\n\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi created what he called a Systems Model for Creativity, shown in the Figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some brief extracts from his book[Reference 1]\n\nMany of these books and articles have tried to answer what has been thought to be the most fundamental question: What is creativity? But no one has raised the simple question that should precede attempts at defining, measuring, or enhancing, namely: Where is creativity? On hearing this question, most people would answer “Why, in the creative person’s head, of course”.\n\n\nAfter studying creativity on and off for almost a quarter of a century, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that this is not the case. We cannot study creativity by isolating individuals and their works from the social and historical milieu in which their actions are carried out.\n\n\nThis is because what we call creative is never the result of individual action alone; it is the product of three main shaping forces:\n\na set of social institutions, or field, that selects from the variations produced by individuals those that are worth preserving;\n\na stable cultural domain that will preserve and transmit the selected new ideas or forms to the following generations;\n\nand finally the individual, who brings about some change in the domain, a change that the field will consider to be creative.\n\n\n\nSo the question “Where is creativity?” cannot be answered solely with reference to the person and the person’s work. Creativity is a phenomenon that results from interaction between these three systems. Without a culturally defined domain of action in which innovation is possible, the person cannot even get started. And without a group of peers to evaluate and confirm the adaptiveness of the innovation, it is impossible to differentiate what is creative from what is simply statistically improbable or bizarre.\n\n\nIf we think about it, the reason we believe that Leonardo or Einstein was creative is that we have read that that is the case, we have been told it is true; our opinions about who is creative and why ultimately are based on faith. We have faith in the domains of art and science, and we trust the judgment of the field, that is, of the artistic and scientific establishments. There is nothing wrong with this, because it is an inevitable situation. But by recognizing it, we must also accept some of its consequences, namely, that any attribution of creativity must be relative, grounded only in social agreement.",

Contrary to what you believe? Outright disturbing?\nI think this is immensely reassuring and humbling at the same time: reassuring because a creative act can be performed by anybody, not some arbitrarily defined “gifted individual”, and humbling, because if field members don’t like your act, or if you don’t have access to the field, you might not make it.

There is a strong sense of history and society right at the heart of TRIZ.\nFurther, the patents the study of which helped Altshuller create TRIZ in the first place belong with domains that we may not necessarily encounter. And yet, the Principles of TRIZ straddle domains and help “cross-domain” solutions to happen: the use of principles in one domain in another, unrelated, domain. (More when we enter TRIZ proper)",

Only in the mid-nineteenth century did some critics begin to reevaluate his work and see in it creative anticipations of modern sensibility. To what extent was creativity contained in Botticelli’s canvases, and to what extent did it emerge from the interpretive efforts of critics like Ruskin?\n\nGregor Mendel\n\n…our view of Mendel’s contribution to genetics is generally quite wrong. The impression we have is that Mendel made a series of epochal experiments in the genetic transmission of traits in the 1860s, but that his creativity was not recognized by the scientific community until about 40 years later. This view is radically mistaken in a subtle but essential respect. (Brannigan) argues that Mendel’s experiments were not and could not have been contributions to genetics at the time they were made. Their implications for the theory of variation and natural selection were discovered only in 1900 by William Bateson and other evolutionists looking for a mechanism that explained discontinuous inheritance. Within their theoretical framework, Mendel’s work suddenly acquired an importance that it had lacked before, even in the mind of Mendel himself.\n\nGalileo Galilei\n The church was definitely the Field for Galileo…",

As she tries to make sense of John’s death and her own changed identity, Didion discovers that grief is not what she expected it to be. Consumed by memories of the years they lived in Los Angeles, shortly after they married and adopted Quintana, Didion feels that she has entered a state of temporary insanity. Though cool and collected on the surface, she begins to believe that her wishes might have the power to bring John back. To this end, she refuses to give away his clothes and shoes, believing that her husband will need them when he returns to her. She calls this childlike belief that her thoughts and wishes can alter reality “magical thinking.”\n\nOf course we are not embarked on anything like this, but we do want to generate some “magic” in our thoughts! So taking some inspiration from her “childlike belief” that can “alter reality”, let us hark back to our childhoods and see what we can do with these objects below:",

    "text": "So What is a Metaphor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantA brief Etymology\n\n\n\n\nMeta (μέτα): This means “among,” “beyond,” “over,” or “beside.” It’s the root for many words meaning “between” or “beside.”\nPherein (φέρειν): This means “to carry” or “to bring.”\n\n\n\n\nA metaphor creates a structural similarity or parallel, ( an Isomorphism, or “similarity in shape”) between two seemingly disparate things, or situations.\nThe familiar thing/situation is called the Source.\nThe new or just encountered thing/situation is called the Target\nThe metaphor detects an Attribute from the Source and transfers it to the Target. An Attribute can be thought of grammatically as an abstract noun such as shininess, roughness, height/depth, position, size, weight, orientation, role, etc.\nThe metaphor works by Mapping Attributes from the Source to the Target. The act of mapping gives a new meaning to the Attribute in its new location in the Target.\nIn its new location, the Attribute is re-purposed and used in a very different way. (E.g. Weight can be repurposed as status. Look up the etymology of the name “Christopher”.)\nThis re-purposing leads to Inference, where the hitherto new object/situation in the Target is understood better using the (pre-purposed and transfered) Attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantA Working Definition\n\n\n\nSo we have a mapping of an attribute from a source to a target, where it is re-purposed and used to make inferences about the target.\n\n\nQuickly read the first three paragraphs of Ref.6.\nActivity-3: Gangs of Wasseypur (from Ref. 3)\nWe will divide into two groups (four if necessary) and contemplate a brief description of the town of Wasseypur. There are 4 short questions / problems for you to consider at the end.\nActivity-4: Seymour Papert Constructionism Game\n    View slides in full screen\n       \n      \n    \n  \nActivity-5: C’est ne une Pipe\n\n\n\nRene Magritte’s La Clef des Songes\n\nLook at the painting above by Rene Magritte, La Clef des Songes (The Key of Dreams). Let us see if we can find a (piece of) a Rene Magritte gene/meme within ourselves.\n\nMagritte’s art has something in common with the rest of the surrealist artists: his art is the juxtaposition of elements that together won’t make a rational sense, but the value of its interpretation lies in the reaction of each spectator’s mind toward the relation of those elements. Magritte’s approach is more conceptual. He exposes how we define things by the word we use to name them creating a word-image series of conflicts. For instance, we think we know what a shoe is because of the definition we give to the word. But what if we replace the name shoe for “moon”? That is what Magritte does in his painting “La Clef des Sognes II” (1930). We see six simple objects and below them it is written a word apparently unrelated to the picture above it, forcing the viewer to think about this relation we have with what we see and what we know. Just like in his painting of “The Treason of Images”, Magritte is trying to show how it doesn’t matter how we name the object, the word will never be one with the object’s physical reality.\nIn general, not only (did he make) this observation through these types of images, but also he usually gives a title for his paintings that has nothing to do with the literal things you see in the image.(emphasis mine)\n\n\nWe will break up into groups of 4-5.\nEach group will be given an Evocative Object, even a household object, perhaps an unusual one.\nYou need to imagine a use for it that is not what is the common known one.\nMarket it as a product that serves this new purpose. Make an ad.\nUse only Gen Z language in your ad. Sigh.\nAd = Performance + Jingle + Poster\n\n(Articles: Bookend made of Wood; Aristo Slide Rules; 80-year-old brass mortar and pestle; Node from Elephant Bamboo stem)\nActivity-6: Metaphorical Story re-Writing\n\nRead the story in Ref.7 and/or Ref.8 below.\nUnderstand the metaphors in the story:\n\nWhat is the story about?\nWhat “metaphorical language” has Joshua Ferris used to describe the characters, their actions, and the results of their actions?\nWhat is the domain of these metaphors in the story?\n\n\nNow, choose a (short!) story that you know really well, something that you may have encountered in school.\nRe-write this story using language, metaphors, and images from any domain (other than what may be in the original story).\n\nFor example, in Primo Levi’s lyrical story Carbon, a lot of metaphors from Chemistry and atomic physics are used to describe life, and connections with people.",

    "text": "Wait, But Why?\n\nMetaphors are power vehicles that shape our ideas, and even our perception of Reality\nThe way we expressed the situation in the Gangs of Wasseypur activity was based on the metaphors used to describe it. It was also a sample case in Priming. Proof, if you ever wanted it, that your first idea is just that, a first idea. Keep going!\nWe are comparing two objects, or situations, using attributes that transfer from one to another.\n\n(The distinction we make between objects and situations is important! More on this when we learn TRIZ.)\n\n\nBased on the domains that you carry in your CC, a metaphor may or may not make sense to you. So yes, working in (diversely constructed) teams to make multiple metaphors may enhance how you appreciate of the situation.\nThe outrageous-ness of the metaphor can often add value to Problem Solving.\nTRIZ, as we will see very soon, uses metaphors for both Problem Definition and Problem Solution. Hence the ability to make metaphors and to work them in both directions would be a super-power\nMetaphors help us break out of Functional Fixedness (see Ref. 3 and Ref. 6), by endowing known objects with new Attributes and Purposes.",

Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” — George Bernard Shaw\n\nAnd from Alice in Wonderland:\n\n\n“How old are you?” said the queen.\n“I’m seven and a half exactly.”\n“You needn’t say “exactly” the queen remarked : “I can believe it without that. Now I’ll give you something to believe. I am just one hundred and one, five months and a day”\n“I can’t believe that!” said Alice.\n“Can’t you?” the Queen said in a pitying tone. “Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.”\nAlice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one can’t believe impossible things.”\n“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”\n\nSo, how “unreasonable” and “impossible” can we become? Alice could not, but the Queen said she could contemplate, and believe, 6 impossible things before breakfast!\nCan we try? How about this?",

(Would you call that a “podclass”?)\n\n\nI believe it should be possible for any patient anywhere to be operated upon by a surgeon anywhere in the world.\nI believe that in a football/soccer game, each player in a team should be able to play multiple roles simultaneously.\nI believe my shirt must make itself clean after being worn for a while.\n\nWhat is our immediate reaction? “It is impossible”. 1\nWhy do we think so? Most likely because we “know”, or rather assume that we know, how things work and these statements may make no sense at all. However, do we actually admit to those ASSUMPTIONs? How do we utter and list them? And then, how if we momentarily pretend they were impossibly not true?\nSuspending the Tyranny of the Assumption, however momentarily allows us to contemplate, safely within our heads, the possibility of a Design Space that is not available…yet. It may show up things that we have been “living with” all along, without questioning why that is so. And therein, we may find an IFR.\nSo, with Objects and Situations, we can now do one more thing to unearth hidden problems that lie within them: look at the Assumptions that make them work. Let us list the Assumptions for some of the above statements, asserting why the statement cannot be true, but what would happen it it were! And of course, you will find yourself repeatedly asking, “What does that even mean??!!??”",

    "text": "Discussion\n\nProblems and Contradictions\nAll Available Resources\n\nAssumptions and Functional Fixedness\n\n\n\nA comparable switch of attention occurs in an old joke about a worker in a high security factory, in which the employees were carefully watched when they left at the end of their work day. On a particular day, this worker was stopped at the factory gate as he walked out with a wheelbarrow full of styrofoam packing peanuts. He explained that he had salvaged these from the trash, and was planning to use them in shipping gifts to his grandchildren. Searching through this packing material, the guards found nothing, and so they let the man go home. The following week the same thing happened, and the worker was again stopped. But he offered the very same story, and when the guards searched through the packing peanuts and found nothing, he was allowed to leave. But this continued, week after week, until the guards could no longer believe that one person would want or could make use of so much packing material. Finally, the man was held for interrogation, at which time he admitted that he had absolutely no use for packing peanuts - and that, all these weeks, he had been stealing wheelbarrows.\n\n\nHearing this joke, I am reminded of the phrase “part and parcel”, which is a rough equivalent of “figure and ground”, the Gestalt Principles. Throughout most of it, the packing peanuts occupy center stage as figure (part), while the wheelbarrows (which function merely as containers) are completely ignored as innocuous ground (parcel). At the end of the joke, there is an unexpected twist, a switch of emphasis, a recentering, when we learn that the parcel is really the part.\n\nThis should also remind us of the Guilford Alternative Uses Exercise that we did, where we forced ourselves to leave the “regular use” of an object behind and think of it as serving quite another function.",

Luckily for him it is not too late!!\nWe have seen how material objects seem to have functional fixedness in our minds. There is an equivalent idea that we can relate to phenomena and processes: we can call it process fixedness. What does it entail?

At the end, they’d give a short presentation on their strategy. What happened next was fascinating:\n\n\nMost of the groups followed a simple approach:\n\nUse the $5 to buy a few items.\nBarter or resell those items.\nRepeat\nSell final items for (hopefully) more than $5.\nThese groups made a modest return on their initial $5.\n\n\n\nA few groups ignored the $5. They thought up ways to make the most money in the allotted time:\n\nMade/sold reservations at hot restaurants.\nRefilled bike tires on campus.\nThese groups made a good return on the initial USD5.\n\n\n\nThe winning group took a very different approach: They had three realizations:\n\nThe $5 was a distraction.\nThe 2 hours of time was not enough to make an attractive, outsized return with a mini-business.\nThe most valuable “asset” was actually the presentation time in front of a class of Stanford students.\nRecognizing the value of the hidden asset, they offered the presentation time to Companies looking to recruit Stanford students.\nThey sold the slot for $650, a huge return on the $5 of initial capital.\n\n\nThe winning group thought differently ( about resources ) and achieved an asymmetric outcome.",

Obtain the Inventive Principles.\nApply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nIn the video itself, we heard about how electrical power consumption centers are the urban areas and these are far away from the generation sites. This leads to capital costs in HT Transmission equipment; we go to HT transmission to reduce losses on the way. This is already a Contradiction, which we might solve using Segmentation to arrive at Local Generation of Power. Local generation is a good idea to reduce these costs. This leads easily to Solar Panels on rooftops for example. Again while this may be cheaper than the electrical distribution system, it still uses a fair bit of capex and space and is centralized per building. Can we take Segmentation even further and think of a hyper-local household-based power generation unit, using the Wind?\nWhat would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around the home? Here below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that some these may sound naive, but that is exactly way to start!\n\nI would like to have access my generator, but it needs to be not too close to the walls for it to harness the wind.\nHow to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection wires get twisted?\nDo I need a conventional Commutator? Won’t that be heavy?\nWhat voltage and current will I get? Will it be compatible with my 230V AC mains?\n\nAs you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our attention. Let us cut to the chase and state perhaps the most interesting problem (to me!) that the inventors have solved as demonstrated in the video above. We will state this as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdministrative Contradiction\n\n\n\nAC: Winds help to generate power by making something rotate, but winds can change direction and slow down the existing rotation.\n\n\nWhat would an IFR be in this situation? How “unreasonable” can we be? Let us try:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantIdeal Final Result\n\n\n\nTorque must be in one direction only (irrespective of wind direction)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionUnidirectional Assumption\n\n\n\nI have made a strong assumption here about the the unidirectional movement: the main intent is for the rotating generator to be able to harness winds from any direction to establish or continue rotation in one direction (CW or CCW). Alternating current power generation is in principle immune to direction of rotation.\n\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix(PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTechnical Contradictions\n\n\n\n\n\nTC 1: Improve (15)Force/Torque while not worsening (3)Angle/Length of Moving Object\n\n\nTC 2: Improve (3)Angle/Length of Moving Object while not worsening (15)Force/Torque\n\n\n\n\nAgain we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters based on our IFR. Other metaphoric TRIZ Parameters that may suggest themselves are 12(Duration of Action on a Moving Object), 14(Speed), and (40)Harmful Effects Acting on the System.\nIs there a Physical Contradiction(PC)2 possible here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningPhysical Contradiction\n\n\n\nThe Rotor must yield and not yield to the Wind at the same time. In other words, the rotor must be “porous and non-porous”3 to the wind at the same time.\n\n\nLet us now apply the TCs to the Contradiction Matrix and obtain the TRIZ Inventive Principles.",

    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix suggests:\nFor TC-1:\n\n17(Another Dimension) !!\n4( Asymmetry)\n14(Curvature) !!!\n10(Preliminary Action)\n\nand with TC-2:\n\n3(Local Quality)\n9(Preliminary Anti-Action)\n35(Parameter Change)\n\nHmm…based on the PC, we may have expected a Separation in Space solution, suggested by Curvature, Another Dimension and Asymmetry. Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions, we try to map these back into the Problem at hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics, geography, and biology.\n\n(14)Curvature: Hmm…nothing new here, or is there? Of course the rotor has to be curved and kind of sphere-like….\n17(Another Dimension): A near-spherical thing has really only one dimension..the radius. And that points in all directions / dimensions! Should there be changes in radius then? Should the radius change create bumps ( positive change ) or depressions ( negative change?) Should the bump be like a welt, and the depression like a groove? How can a bump or a depression itself be curved, as 14(Curvature) suggests?\n4(Asymmetry): The bumps or depressions…..they have to be asymmetric? So….not like longitudes and nor latitudes, but may be like those great circles.\n\n3(Local Quality): OK, the bumps or depressions are already “local”….can we go further? Here is where I stretch and go hyper-local: Should there be structures on or inside them, like flaps or fins or vanes? How can these be asymmetric, then? By acting like miniature flaps or trapdoors, that yield / fall flat when pushed in one direction and stand up / resist when pushed in the other direction…somewhat like a dog or cat’s fur? Then push and pull work differently…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFrom Flaps to ….Funnels!\n\n\n\nMaking these flaps movable as the above paragraph seems to suggest would probably not be a good idea, from an engineering standpoint. But once we have the image of wind + flaps / fins / vanes and differences in pressure or movement, the Bernoulli Principle and Venturi effect suggest themselves immediately!! So what could this vane-fin-fur-flap thingy be then? Oh good heavens, a funnel !!!\n\n\n{HappyApple, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons}\nSo each of those bumps are segmented into funnel-like structures that cause differences in air pressure when the wind blow. These differences are unidirectional and create movement/rotation! And because the bumps are curved along the surface of the sphere, and they are not parallel to one another (asymmetry), at least some of the internal funnels will always be “in the wind” 4, and capable of creating rotation using Bernoulli/Venturi effect!\n\n9(Preliminary Anti-Action): What do we wish to guard against? Counter acting wind forces. Well, the funnel structures work only with wind blowing into the broad opening and so we are fine!\n\nSo finally we could just imagine a spherical object, mounted on a spindle, with spiral arc-like bumps at different places on the surfaces. Within the arc-like bumps are funnel-like structures that create differentials in pressure when subject to the wind, and that creates rotation. Since the funnels are asymmetric by nature, our final rotation is unidirectional. Whew! ( Yes, that “whew” is also very suggestive here 😃!)",

This is a Physical Contradiction! In this case we can easily see and application of Separation in Space and also Separation on Condition. However I think in this case, it would not be easy to arrive at the Solution using just these.\nThat’s a wrap! In the next episode of the #TRIZ Chronicles, I wish to step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR!

    "text": "Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary\nThe movie is the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks. The stellar cast includes Peter O’Toole as Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Ali, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Claude Raines as Dryden, and Anthony Quayle as Col. Brighton. The director was David Lean. The editing of the film by Anne Coates is also much admired. ( https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/tag/lawrence-of-arabia/ )\nLawrence is a complex, talented, and yet simple man, who is extremely well read (Greek philosophy and the Koran, for example) and is also an expert in Arab affairs and has considerable skill at map-making. Due to his being interpreted as insolent and insubordinate , he is given a lowly job at the HQ in Cairo. Dryden manages to convince the General that Lawrence should be allowed to go into Arabia and to find out what kind of long-term plans Prince Feisal is making for Arabia.\nHere is the map of the events that are unfolding in the movie at this time.1\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence encounters Ali in dramatic fashion at the Masturah Well, on the way to meet Feisal, and his Arab guide is shot by Ali, a direct experience for Lawrence of inter-tribe rivalry in Arabia. (Ali is a Harith, and Tafas the guide was a Hashemi). Lawrence peremptorily rejects an offer of help from Ali, and finds his way alone to Wadi Safra, where Feisal is camped. He is met by Col. Brighton as he nears the camp. Both enter camp just in time to witness another bombing raid by Turkish airplanes.\nLater in the meeting with Feisal, Brighton tries to convince Feisal to retreat to Yenbo (Yanbu) and be out of range for the Turks, and where the British Army would supply them, train them to fight against the Turks. Feisal reluctantly accepts this plan, though he would rather the British navy take the port city of Aqaba and supply his army from there. Brighton simply scoffs at that idea, because the Turkish have 12 inch guns at Aqaba and the British have other things to do.\nLawrence has already intrigued Feisal by completing a verse from the Koran as it was being read by Selim, the cleric. At the end of the meeting, Feisal confronts Lawrence alone, as to his intentions in Arabia and finds out, to his astonishment, that Lawrence has his own interpretation of what his tasks and loyalties were, and these did not necessarily coincide with those of Brighton. In fact, Lawrence is not in favour of the Arab Army’s retreat to Yenbo, as it would become one small part of the British Army. As a parting remark, Feisal says to Lawrence that the Arabs need what no man can provide, a miracle.\nHere is the video of that terrific tent meeting scene.",

Provoked by Feisal’s parting remark, he sits up all night on a sand dune close to the camp, thinking about how Aqaba could be taken, since he wants the Arabs to continue fighting from where they were, and even advance if possible with British help. His detailed understanding of the Arabian geography, his knowledge of the Aqaba port and its fortifications, all come to the fore here. Aqaba is a port at the head end of a narrow gulf to the east of the Sinai Peninsula.\nIn the early morning, seemingly in a eureka moment, he decides that attacking Aqaba from the landward side would be a good solution, since the guns there could not be turned around.\nHere is Lawrence trying to convince Ali about this plan:\n\n\n\n\nLawrence does not inform Brighton of his plans, nor even Feisal. It is Ali who informs Feisal of this enterprise. Clearly, Lawrence does not consider Brighton as a member of his Field (as defined by Csikszentmihalyi in his Creativity Systems Model), but Feisal is a Field Member to Ali.\nApropos, the act of sitting up all night can be seen as the Incubation and Elaboration stages of the 5 Stages of Creativity from Csikszentmihalyi (Preparation, Incubation, Insight, Elaboration, Execution).",

Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdministrative Contradictions\n\n\n\nAC: The Arabs need the British to supply them via Aqaba port. Aqaba has huge guns and they will sink the British ships in that narrow gulf if they try a naval attack. So the Arabs need to take Aqaba without losing British ships.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define the Ideal Final Result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIdeal Final Result\n\n\n\nIFR: The Arabs need to attack and take Aqaba port, and the big guns there should have no effect.\n\n\nNote how the tone of this IFR is like a “eat my cake and have it too”. Very typical for IFRs, this impossible-sounding tone!\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC). We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can attempt, stating the Contradiction both ways2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTechnical Contradictions\n\n\n\n- TC 1: Increase Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12) and not worsen Stability of Objects Composition (21)\n- TC 2: Increase Stability of Objects Composition (21) and not worsen Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12)\n\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that the guns at Aqaba should not affect the Arab attack at all. The Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Power(18) or Illumination Intensity(23) to “metaphorize” the effectiveness of the attack, if our imaginations run in that direction. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could even stretch to making a Physical Contradiction(PC)3 happen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhysical Contradictions\n\n\n\nPC: The Ships must be near the guns but not be near enough to be shot at. (They must be near and not near at the same time)",

    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 24 (Intermediary)\n\nIP 40 (Composite Materials)\n\nand (TC2)\n\nIP 10 (Preliminary Action)\n\nIP 5 (Merging)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nHow are we to apply these Inventive Principles? Here again is an imaginative exercise as we map these Generalized Solutions back into the Problem at hand:\n\nIP 13: The Other Way Around. Change the Direction? Of what? Two aspects have “direction” as attributes: the attack, and the guns, which Lawrence can’t control. So how does he use this? Not attack by sea? Wait…ATTACK BY LAND!! Change the DIRECTION of Attack! So attack from the other side, the land side!! (We could retrospectively add this parameter to the Ishikawa Diagram too). Will this work? Yes, the guns can’t turn around!!\nIP 35: Parameter Change. But “ships” on land?? Note, the desert is an ocean into which no oar is dipped. Sand and Water are both Resources in the problem, as we have duly noted in the Ishikawa Diagram. So a different kind of ocean and therefore a different kind of ship? At a stretch, we can say the warships of the British Navy are being substituted with the use of ….Camels!! And, metaphorically speaking, it is still an attack using ships….The Ships of the Desert!! So water becomes sand, and the warships become camels using Parameter Change !\nIP 10: Prior Action. How? Lawrence and Ali are far from Aqaba and cannot do anything “in advance”. What could this be?\nIP 5: Merging. However, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence and Ali must recruit the Howeitat tribe “in advance” of their attack !! As Lawrence tells Ali, If 50 men came out of the Nefud Desert, they might be 50 men other men would join. This is in accordance with what IP 10 is suggesting, to get other tribes to join in, in advance of the attack.\nIP 40: Composite Materials. What object within the situation can we reconstitute with smaller pieces of different types? The British Army…so an army made up of pieces? Yes! The Tribes need to unite into one composite army.\nAnd, instead of large warships, the Arabs switch to a composite force with camels…\n\nSo IP 13 works nicely now, along with IP 35 and IP 40, to give us a camel-borne attack from the landward side. IP 10 also teams up with IP 40 and IP 5 to give the idea of tribe unification.\nAnd so Lawrence and Ali, with the help of Auda Abu Tayi, attack Aqaba port from the landward side by crossing the Nefud desert on camels, and take it! And we have justified their decision using TRIZ !!\nHere is the final solution in action !!\n\n\n\n\n I hope that was as much fun to read as it was for me to write it up !!",
