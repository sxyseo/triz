This is Water: David Foster Wallace's famous Talk:\n{{< youtube eC7xzavzEKY >}} <br> 4. Let us quickly read and discuss this\nextract from the **Play and Playground Encyclopedia**\n<https://www.pgpedia.com/m/man-play-and-games>\n\n## Discussion #2\n\n-   Is the idea of Flow elusive?\n-   Do only some people get it, and then only at some times?\n-   Was David Foster Wallace's talk somewhat self-deluding?\n-   Then what is this *Empathy* stuff we talk about when we speak of\n    Design Thinking?\n\n## Pop Quix: Want still more Flow?\n\nNo, that is not a bad spelling....why not?\n\nGo find me in this picture !! <br>\n\n![Pillar Rock](Pillar.JPG)\n\n## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusions\n\n- Flow is a `Zone of Play` between the rising `Floor of Boredom` and the approaching `Ceiling of Anxiety / Challenge`\n- You need to use the Boredom to push away the Ceiling to stay in Play\n- To do that, you may need to:\n  - Break Rules: Change how you experience things\n  - Understand your Assumptions: ( More on this later)\n  - Use and Create Surprises: Spot the Problem lurking in your Boredom\n\n\n## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?\n\n- Flow is a great state to be in when you are working\n- It enables you to experience your work, your problem solving, in a way that is unique and hyper productive\n- And...\n- If you build / design some thing, wouldn't you want flow for the people who use that thing?\n- Flow is your gift to your users / customers / clients / audience !!\n- And so, it is both a beginning, and an end in Design!!\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1.
