Problem 1. (Salamatov) A robot was brought to a plant to operate a machine. After it was rigged up\nand switched on, the elderly worker who had operated the machine for years was\namazed at seeing the nimble ‘iron man’ performing all the necessary steps.\nA half an hour later, however, the robot came to a standstill, to the bewilderment\nof the service team of electronic engineers. What happened? As it turned out, some\nchips had fallen from the workpiece into the moving element of the machine. This\nsituation where a human worker would simply flip the chips away with a broom and\ncontinue working brought a robot to a deadlock. The engineers cleaned the machine\nwith a broom, switched on the robot... only to see the robot stop again. How could this\nproblem be solved? Obviously, one cannot attach a human worker with a broom to the\nrobot...\n\n1. Problem 2. (Salamatov) A production line with robots installed at a clothing mill was unable to\nperform the cutting and stitching of the pieces of clothes properly. The pieces of fabric\nare not stiff, so the robots creased them with their grippers, stitched them Z-fold and\nmade many other slips. Using clamps and servo-systems equipped with optical sensors\nand cameras did not help. Then it was suggested to wet the fabric so that it could stick firmly to the conveyer. And this, in turn, was useless, because the pieces were sticking\ntogether, crumpled up and got deformed. What could be done?\n\n1. Problem 3. (Salamatov) A wafer with IC and other electronic components is usually given a coat of\nvarnish that protects the wafer from exposure to negative interference. The varnish\ncoating is then dried under elevated temperature. At this stage microscopic bubbles of\ngas evolve at some points of the wafer from the flux left after soldering, penetrating the\nvarnish coating before it dries up. The bubbles damage the integrity of the protective\ncoating. What can be done?\n\n1. Problem 6. (Salamatov) While drilling deep boreholes in the earth it is essential to monitor the\ncondition of the teeth of the instrument that digs into the rock, for the teeth will break off\nsometimes. Unaware of the condition of teeth, a technician has to work blindly, regularly\nreplacing the working instrument with a new one (just in case). To do this, the entire\ncolumn of pipes is pulled out of the borehole which is often a few miles deep. However,\nreplacing consumes too much time and labor. It is necessary to find a simple way to\ncontrol the condition of the working instrument.\n\n1. Problem 7. (Salamatov) Everyone knows how the incubator works. But can incubation be carried\nout in space? Space station provides all the necessary conditions for incubation\n(atmosphere, heat), except one: gravity. That is why chickens simply won’t hatch! An\nidea for the space incubator is wanted. What would you recommend for creating\nartificial gravity?\n\n1. Problem 8. (Salamatov) Edison used to offer ‘tricky’ technical problems to his would-be employees,\nespecially theoreticians. Once he invited a mathematician into his lab, and asked him to\ncalculate the volume of a bulb. For more than an hour the mathematician was busy\ndoing measurements and intricate calculations. He dealt with the task successfully and\nproudly handed Edison a sheet of paper with the answer. To mathematician’s\nbewilderment, in a few seconds Edison demonstrated an easier (and more reliable) way\nto measure the bulb.\n\n1. Problem 9. (Salamatov) The Dutch company advertises a device that provides rectilinear micro-\ndisplacements (measuring hundredths of micrometers) in microscopes. The device is\nvery complex and contains an electric motor, a worm gear, a two-stage friction gear, all\ncomponents being made of special hard steel with exceptional, precision, accuracy.\nThe company emphasizes the advantages: no backlash, no lost motion, no lubricants\nused.\nDesign a primitive device that uses a principle known from elementary school\nphysics, has no lost motion but greater accuracy.\n\n1. ZEBRA OR WAVES? (Salamatov)\nA town square was turned into a playground for children. At the same time it was impossible to\nbar the traffic in an adjoining street. This gave rise to a problem: is it possible to make motorists\nslow down while driving past the playground? Two proposals were put forth: covering a part of the\nstreet with a zebra crossing or giving this section of the road a waved profile. The first way was\ncheap but had a restricted effect, the second was safe but expensive. The desired solution should\ncombine the advantages but be devoid of the disadvantages. What would you suggest?\n\n1. FIRE OR ABASEMENT? (Salamatov)\nLucas Cranach Junior, famous artist, was commissioned to paint a portrait of Cardinal Albrecht of\nBrandenburg, a notoriously cruel figure of those days. Cardinal was to be depicted in his own\nstudy, a Bible and a Crucifix in his hands. Showing the true character of Cardinal was out of\nquestion, but compromising would be immoral. What could be done?\n",
