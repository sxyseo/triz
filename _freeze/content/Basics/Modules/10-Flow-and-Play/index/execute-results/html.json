Yes, you.\n\n## Discussion #1: Play\n\nHow did you play?\n\n-   Did you get bored?\n-   Did you lose sense of time at any point?\n-   Did anything become too difficult at any time?\n-   What did you do at such times?\n\nLet us quickly review the [four central ideas in Play by Robert Caillois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Play_and_Games).\n\n## What is Flow?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Flow.png){fig-align='center' width=100% height=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe will understand **Flow** from:\n\n1.  The book the book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, titled [**Flow: The Psychology of Happiness**](Flow_%20The%20Psychology%20of%20Happiness%20-%20Csikszentmihalyi,%20Mihaly.pdf). First, let us learn to say his name!!\n\n`<audio controls> <source src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Mih%C3%A1ly_Cs%C3%ADkszentmih%C3%A1lyi.ogg' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>`{=html} \n\n\n  Let us read the relevant pages (pp. 72-76, *Flow Activities*). This section nicely juxtaposes Csikszentmihalyi's ideas of `Flow` and Caillois ideas of `Play`, and states, as a finding of their research, that:\n\n  >....every flow activity, whether it involved competition, chance, or any other dimension of experience, had this in common: It provided a sense of discovery, a creative feeling of transporting the person into a new reality. It pushed the person to higher levels of performance, and led to previously undreamed-of states of consciousness. In short, it transformed the self by making it more complex. \n\n\n1.

This is Water: David Foster Wallace's famous Talk:\n<br>\n{{< youtube eC7xzavzEKY >}}\n<br> \n\n\n## Discussion #2\n\n-   Is the idea of Flow elusive? Is it similar to Play? \n-   Do only some people get it, and then only at some times?\n-   Was David Foster Wallace's talk somewhat self-deluding?\n-   Then what is this *Empathy* stuff we talk about when we speak of Design Thinking?\n\n\n## Pop \"Quinx\": Want still more Flow?\n\nNo, that is not a bad spelling....why not? Go find me in this picture !! <br>\n\n![Pillar Rock](Pillar.JPG)\n\n## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusions\n\n- Flow is a `Zone of Play` between the rising `Floor of Boredom` and the approaching `Ceiling of Anxiety / Challenge` ( my \"definition\"!)\n- You need to use the Boredom to push away the Ceiling to stay in Play\n- To do that, you may need to:\n  - Break Rules: Change how you experience / perceive things\n  - Understand your Assumptions: ( More on this later)\n  - Use and Create Surprises: Spot the Problem lurking in your Boredom\n  - Grow More Skills to handle higher Complexity\n\n\n## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?\n\n- Flow is a great state to be in when you are working\n- It enables you to experience your work, your problem solving, in a way that is unique and hyper productive\n- And...\n- If you build / design some thing, wouldn't you want flow for the people who use that thing?\n- Flow is your gift to your users / customers / clients / audience !!\n- And so, it is both a beginning, and an end in Design!!\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1.
