Let us do that, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.\n\n### Icebreaker Game!\n\nLook at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:\n\n-   *Silently* work through the slide until you have found all the numbers\\\n-   Raise your hand when you have done so.\n\n### A Personality Game\n\nI have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:\n\n-   Discuss how to complete the Task\\\n-   Complete the Task and document your work\\\n-   *Also* document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.\\\n-   Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team\n\n## References\n\n1.

MBTI Game: [PDF](/pdf/MBTI%20Activities.pdf)\n\n## Why does this Matter to Us\n\n- In the Icebreaker Game, some of you would have difficulty trying to spot the pattern WITHOUT discussing with your friends!\n- Others would have perhaps frowned at the slightest whisper in the class, as they were concentrating!\n\n- In the Team Game, you might have realized that each of the 4 teams had members that were different in ONE of the MBTI characteristics! So I had pitted `I vs E people`; `N vs S people`; `T vs F people`, and `J vs P people`. The tasks allocated to each of you was precisely one to make that *dichotomy* surface in your discussions. And of course, the documentation of the discussions was far more important than the end results !! ;-D\n\nSo what have learnt then? From the two exercises, we see that:  \n\n  - Reality depends upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view. Note that this is about our *cognitive bias* that may depend upon our cultural outlook, and our ability to miss things. \n  - It is emphatically not about <u>[alternative facts](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/alternative-facts/)</u> which is arrant nonsense.\n  - We all have our \"default modes\" for behaviour, that give us a restricted appreciation of the World\n  - As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better. \n  - Comprehending reality better gives a stronger basis for Art/Design **decisions** and plans for action.\n\n## Additional References\n\n1.
