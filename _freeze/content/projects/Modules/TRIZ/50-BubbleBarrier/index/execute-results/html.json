The other 20% come from marine sources such as fishing\n> nets, ropes, and fleets. To tackle plastic pollution we need to know\n> where these plastics are coming from. Previous studies suggested that\n> a very small number of rivers were responsible for the vast majority\n> of ocean plastics: 60% to 90% of plastics came from only ten rivers.\n>\n> Higher-resolution mapping and consideration for factors such as\n> climate, terrain, land use, and distance to the ocean suggests ***that\n> many smaller rivers play a bigger role than we thought***. It takes\n> 1,600 of the biggest emitting rivers to account for 80% of plastic\n> inputs to the ocean.\n>\n> It is estimated that 81% of ocean plastics come from Asian rivers. The\n> Philippines alone contribute around one-third of the global total.\n> Since the number of contributing rivers is much higher than previously\n> thought, we will need ***global efforts*** to improve waste management\n> and plastic collection rather than targeting only a few of the largest\n> rivers.\n>\n> The latest research, which was just published in Science Advances,\n> updates our understanding of how these plastics are distributed.[^1]\n> Lourens Meijer et al. (2021) developed higher-resolution modeling of\n> global riverine plastics. They found that rivers emitted around 1\n> million tonnes of plastics into the oceans in 2015 (with an\n> uncertainty ranging from 0.8 to 2.7 million tonnes). Around one-third\n> of the 100,000 river outlets that they modeled contributed to this.\n> The other two-thirds emitted almost no plastic to the ocean. It's an\n> important point because we might think that most, if not all, rivers\n> are contributing to the problem. This is not the case.\n>\n> But, importantly, the latest research suggests that smaller rivers\n> play a much larger role than previously thought. In the chart we see\n> the comparison of the latest research (in red) with the two earlier\n> studies which mapped global riverine inputs. This chart shows how many\n> of the top-emitting rivers (on the x-axis) make up a given percentage\n> of plastic inputs (y-axis). Note that the number of rivers on the\n> x-axis is given on a logarithmic scale.[***emphasis mine***]\n\nSo the problem is more widespread **at source** and therefore\ndistributed local solutions are needed.\n\n# So, Is there a Solution?\n\nIt seems we need to prevent plastics entering the oceans, by preventing\ntheir flow in our rivers and streams, effectively dealing with the\nproblem *at source*. And that such a solution needs to be in widespread\nuse ( \\>1600 rivers ) in order for it to be successful. So it needs to\nbe simple, effective and not terribly costly.\n\nIt seems that the beautiful city of Amsterdam, with its lovely canals,\nhas a solution already!\n\n<iframe width=\"760\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_KwF-gf0S0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n<br>\n\nIn the following, we will analyze this solution from a TRIZ standpoint.\nWe will construct **Contradictions**, specify the **Ideal Final\nResult**, and find solutions using the **Contradiction Matrix**. We will\nthen interpret and apply the **Inventive Principles** suggested by the\nmatrix into the problem and show how the video above can be depicted as\nyet another TRIZ solution! We will also very briefly foray into using\nanother aspect of TRIZ, namely the **Separation Principles** this time.\n\n## A TRIZ Analysis of the Amsterdam Bubble Barrier\n\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\n\n-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source\n    TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k \"Open Source TRIZ on YouTube\")**,**\n    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation\n\n-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /\n    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.\n\n-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and\n    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive\n    Principles.\n\n-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\n\n    ![](TRIZ.png)\n    \nHere below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify the\n*Parameters* of this Problem:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach of the above terms in the Ishikawa can be a **knob** for us.\n<u>[**Turning the *knobs/parameters* in the Ishikawa\nDiagram**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k \"Open Source TRIZ on Youtube\")</u>,\nwe try to improve a certain Parameter or we try to reduce its effect. In\ndoing so we could construct several alternative **Problem\nDescriptions**. ( Of course not all Parameters may be accessible in a\ngiven situation )\n\n-   We want to deal with the (hopefully) smaller quantities of plastic\n    closer to source, rather than the much larger quantities as we get\n    nearer and into the high seas.\n\n-   Clearly we want the rivers to flow and give us our sense of\n    <u>[**beauty, serenity and movement, and\n    poetry**](https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/105/the-wind-in-the-willows/1795/the-open-road/ \"The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame\")</u>,\n    but the same flow should not transport plastics downstream.\n\n-   We also want the plastic, if we can stop it from floating onward, to\n    be \"accessible\" and be easily gathered from the stream.\n\n-   So a simple dam or\n    <u>[**weir-like**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir \"Weir on Wikipedia\")</u>\n    structure, or a net could work, but would possibly ruin our sense of\n    beauty. For example, we could consider stopping the flow of water in\n    places with weirs, but then that could make the location ugly and be\n    a hindrance to recreation and transportation. The presence of\n    plastics in the water could also alter the colour of the water.\n\n-   Finally, we are interested in preserving dissolved oxygen in the\n    water. We want to prevent *other organic decaying material*\n    accumulating around the plastic and increasing the <u>[**Biological\n    Oxygen Demand**](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/biological-oxygen-demand-bod-and-water)</u>\n    Not to mention the smell.\n\nSo many problems !!\n\nWith all this discussion, we can state at least one of our Problems as\nan <u>[**Administrative\nContradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp)</u>\nin *plain English*:\n\n::: callout-note\n### Administrative Contradiction\n**AC**: We wish to pull out plastics from the **river**\nwithout interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational / transportation )\n:::\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa\nDiagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ *Ideal Final Result*:\n\n::: callout-note\n### Ideal Final Result\n**IFR**: The River must flow. The Plastics must not.\n:::\n\nShort and pithy.\n\nWe could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our\nfocus was. (Our focus here is the **river)**. The way we would look at\nthe Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case.\nMore on this in just a bit!\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,\nkeeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in\nthe <u>[**TRIZ Contradiction Matrix**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf)</u> and see which\nParameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what\nwe can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways[^2]:\n\n::: callout-note\n### Technical Contradictions\n- **TC 1**: Increase `Volume of Stationary Object`(8) and not worsen `Harmful effects acting on the system`(40)\n- **TC 2**: Improve `Harmful effects acting on the system`(40) and not worsen `Volume of Stationary Object`(8)\n:::\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects\nthat we choose the make the **river** our focus. We want to increase the\n`volume` of the stationary plastic **in the river**, while not worsening\nthe `harmful effects` acting on the **river**. Note how the IFR is\nincluded here, in using the word **stationary** for the object: the\nplastic must **not** flow, while the river **must**.\n\nAs stated in my previous articles,\nthere is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative\ninterpretations of the AC, using the *language of TRIZ*, the **48\nParameters** in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the\nTRIZ Matrix can be thought of as *metaphors* for the knobs that lie\nwithin our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of *making\nmetaphors*. We could easily have chosen the Parameter\n`Amount of Substance (10)` i.e. the plastic *on the river*, as the\n\"metaphoric thing\" to improve but the current IFR speaks of the\n**river**. Or we could choose `Aesthetics and Appearance (39)` as our\ntarget, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed\nmanner. TRIZ tends to <u>[**focus our\nattention**](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/kahneman/files/attention_hi_quality.pdf \"Daniel Kahneman\")</u>\nlike no other method that I know of.\n\nWe could also formulate a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^3]:\n\n::: callout-note\n### Physical Contradiction\n**PC**: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River at the same time.\n:::\n\nwhich is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is\nformulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and\nPC.\n\n## Solving the Technical Contradiction\n\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive\nat the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution\nfor `TC-1` in the figure below; The square for solutions to `TC-1` has\nbeen circled in red.\n\n![](matrix.png)\n\nHere is what the Matrix suggests:\n\nFor `TC-1`:\n\n1.  39(Inert Atmosphere)\n\n2.  24(Intermediary)\n\n3.  19(Periodic Action)\n\n4.  27(Cheap Short-Living Objects) (**!!**)\n\n    and with `TC-2`:\n\n5.  5(Merging)\n\n6.  17(Another Dimension)\n\n7.  ~~39(Inert Atmosphere)~~\n\n8.  ~~19(Periodic Action)~~\n\nThis is neat list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these\nInventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we\n*Generalized Solutions* we try to map these back into the Problem at\nhand:\n\n-   `(39)Inert Atmosphere`: Hmm...what can be inert in the River? What\n    could \"inert\" mean here? The River should be inert...so must not\n    flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!\n-   `24(Intermediary)`: OK, something between the River and the\n    Plastic. But...we don't want nets or dams or weirs...then what? Need\n    to think!!\n-   `19(Periodic Action)`: What can be \"periodic\" in the River? Waves?\n    But how do we **make** waves? Need to think some more!!\n-   `27(Cheap Short Living Objects)`: What can be cheap short and\n    short living in the River water? Not fish, surely...wait,\n    **BUBBLES**!!!\n\nSo, <u>[breathlessly](https://youtu.be/nWeax5joZFw)</u>: we create bubbles in the water and use them as an\n*Intermediary* to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we\nwant it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both *Inert*\n**and** *Atmosphere*, literally! And they are *Cheap* and *Short-Lived*\nso we need to regenerate them *Periodically!* We can periodically\n*sweep* the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb\nany other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!\n\n`5(Merging)` is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect.\n`17(Another Dimension)` is also evocative and powerful as a Solution:\nthe River flows *horizontally* but the barrier we need to create is\n*vertical*. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles\n*dissolve in the River water* (assuming *another dimension,* as it\nwere) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains\ndo!!\n\nSo there you have it! It seems that <u>[**Going\nDutch**](https://thegreatbubblebarrier.com/ \"The Great Bubble Barrier\")</u>\neven with bubbles, is a good idea !\n\n## Using TRIZ Separation Principles\n\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**\nparameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*\nfor example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*.\n\nOur IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to\nflow at the same time. But the Plastics are\n<u>[**in**](https://christophertyler.org/CWTyler/AlicePDFs/13treacle.pdf \"The Treacle Well ( Alice in Wonderland )\")</u>\nthe River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!\n\nCan we make the River \"less of a River\" in places? Can we make\n**separate** zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to\nharvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as `(39)Inert\nAtmosphere` and `24(Intermediary)` suggest such a \"spatial\"\nseparation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a\nPhysical Contradiction related to \"time\". TRIZ offers us a smaller and\nmore easily \"memorizable\" set of metaphoric solutions in the form of\n**Separation Principles**. Here they are:\n\n-   [Separation in Time]{.smallcaps}\n-   [Separation in Space]{.smallcaps}\n-   [Separation on Condition]{.smallcaps}\n-   [Separation between Parts and the Whole]{.smallcaps}\n\nNote that while these *Separation Principles* are just a handful to\nmemorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway.\nBut then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles\nin the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew\nto a particular kind of *Separation* *Principle.*\n\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ,\nplease send me a DM!
