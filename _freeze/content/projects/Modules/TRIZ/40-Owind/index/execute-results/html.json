The\ninventors are [Nicolas\nOrellana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicorellana/) and [Yaseen\nNoorani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaseen-noorani-b5402a79/?originalSubdomain=uk).\n\nWithout further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable\ninvention.\n\n## A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator\n\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as\n[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ \"https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/\"):\n\n-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source\n    TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k \"Open Source TRIZ on YouTube\")**,**\n    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation\n-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /\n    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.\n-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and\n    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive\n    Principles.\n-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nIn the video itself, we heard about how electrical power **consumption\ncenters** are the urban areas and these are far away from the\n**generation sites**. This leads to capital costs in HT Transmission\nequipment; we go to HT transmission to reduce losses on the way. This is\nalready a *Contradiction*, which we might solve using **Segmentation**\nto arrive at *Local Generation of Power*. Local generation is a good\nidea to reduce these costs. This leads easily to Solar Panels on\nrooftops for example. Again while this *may* be cheaper than the\nelectrical distribution system, it still uses a fair bit of capex and\nspace and is centralized per building. Can we take **Segmentation** even\nfurther and think of a hyper-local *household-based* power generation\nunit, using the Wind?\n\nWhat would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around\nthe home? Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify\nthe *Parameters* of this Problem:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them\noff and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up\nseveral problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked\nsome of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and\nnot direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that\nsome these may sound *naive*, but that is exactly way to start!\n\n1.  I would like to have access my generator, but it needs to be not too\n    close to the walls for it to harness the wind.\n2.  How to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection\n    wires get twisted?\n3.  Do I need a conventional\n    [Commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric))?\n    Won't that be heavy?\n4.  What voltage and current will I get? Will it be compatible with my\n    230V AC mains?\n\nAs you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our\nattention. Let us cut to the chase and state perhaps the most\ninteresting problem (to me!) that the inventors have solved as\ndemonstrated in the video above. We will state this as an\n[**Administrative\nContradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp \"https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp\")\nin *plain English*:\n\n::: callout-note\n## Administrative Contradiction\n\n**AC**: Winds help to generate power by making something rotate, but\nwinds can change direction and slow down the existing rotation.\n:::\n\nWhat would an IFR be in this situation? How \"unreasonable\" can we be?\nLet us try:\n\n::: callout-important\n## Ideal Final Result\n\nTorque must be in one direction only (irrespective of wind direction)\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Unidirectional Assumption\n\nI have made a strong assumption here about the the unidirectional\nmovement: the main intent is for the rotating generator to be able to\nharness winds from any direction to establish or continue rotation in\none direction (CW or CCW). Alternating current power generation is in\nprinciple immune to direction of rotation.\n:::\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,\nkeeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in\nthe [**TRIZ**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf)\n[**Contradiction**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf \"Download PDF of TRIZ Contradiction Matrix 2003\")\n[**Matrix(PDF)**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which\nParameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what\nwe can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways[^1]:\n\n::: callout-note\n## Technical Contradictions\n\n-   **TC 1**: Improve `(15)Force/Torque` while not worsening\n    `(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object`\n-   **TC 2**: Improve `(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object` while not\n    worsening `(15)Force/Torque`\n:::\n\nAgain we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters based on our IFR. Other\nmetaphoric TRIZ Parameters that may suggest themselves are\n`12(Duration of Action on a Moving Object)`, `14(Speed)`, and\n`(40)Harmful Effects Acting on the System`.\n\nIs there a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^2] possible here?\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Physical Contradiction\n\nThe Rotor must yield and not yield to the Wind at the same time. In\nother words, the rotor must be \"porous and non-porous\"[^3] to the wind\nat the same time.\n:::\n\nLet us now apply the TCs to the Contradiction Matrix and obtain the TRIZ\nInventive Principles.\n\n## Solving the Technical Contradiction\n\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive\nat the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix\nsuggests:\n\nFor `TC-1`:\n\n1.  **17(Another Dimension) !!**\n2.  **4( Asymmetry)**\n3.  **14(Curvature) !!!**\n4.  **10(Preliminary Action)**\n\nand with `TC-2`:\n\n5.  **3(Local Quality)**\n6.  **9(Preliminary Anti-Action)**\n7.  **35(Parameter Change)**\n\nHmm...based on the PC, we may have expected a **Separation in Space**\nsolution, suggested by *Curvature, Another Dimension and Asymmetry*.\nViewing these Inventive Principles as we [*Generalized\nSolutions*]{.underline}*,* we try to map these back into the Problem at\nhand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ\nembodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics,\ngeography, and biology.\n\n1.  **(14)Curvature**: Hmm...nothing new here, or is there? Of course\n    the rotor has to be curved and kind of sphere-like....\n\n2.  **17(Another Dimension)**: A near-spherical thing has really only\n    one dimension..the radius. And that points in all directions /\n    dimensions! Should there be changes in radius then? Should the\n    radius change create bumps ( positive change ) or depressions (\n    negative change?) Should the bump be like a welt, and the depression\n    like a groove? How can a bump or a depression *itself* be curved, as\n    **14(Curvature)** suggests?\n\n3.  **4(Asymmetry)**: The bumps or depressions.....they have to be\n    asymmetric? So....not like *longitudes* and nor *latitudes*, but may\n    be like those [**great\n    circles**](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatCircle.html \"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatCircle.html\").\n\n4.  **3(Local Quality)**: OK, the bumps or depressions are already\n    \"local\"....can we go further? Here is where I stretch and go\n    *hyper-local*: Should there be structures on or inside them, like\n    flaps or fins or vanes? How can these be *asymmetric*, then? By\n    acting like miniature flaps or\n    [trapdoors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLfrZrXC-g \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLfrZrXC-g\"),\n    that yield / fall flat when pushed in one direction and stand up /\n    resist when pushed in the other direction...somewhat like a dog or\n    cat's fur? Then *push* and *pull* work differently...\n\n    ::: callout-tip\n    ## From Flaps to ....Funnels!\n\n    Making these flaps *movable* as the above paragraph seems to suggest\n    would probably not be a good idea, from an engineering standpoint.\n    But once we have the image of *wind + flaps / fins / vanes* and\n    *differences in pressure or movement*, the **Bernoulli Principle**\n    and **Venturi effect** suggest themselves immediately!! So what\n    could this vane-fin-fur-flap thingy be then? Oh good heavens, a\n    [**funnel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQL1ju3RoQ \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQL1ju3RoQ\")\n    !!!\n    :::\n\n    ![Venturi\n    Effect](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Venturi5.svg){HappyApple,\n    Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons}\n\n    So each of those bumps are **segmented** into funnel-like structures\n    that cause differences in air pressure when the wind blow. These\n    differences are *unidirectional* and create movement/rotation! And\n    because the bumps are curved along the surface of the sphere, *and\n    they are not parallel to one another* (**asymmetry**), at least some\n    of the internal funnels will always be \"in the wind\" [^4], and\n    capable of creating rotation using Bernoulli/Venturi effect!\n\n5.  **9(Preliminary Anti-Action)**: What do we wish to guard against?\n    Counter acting wind forces. Well, the funnel structures work only\n    with wind blowing into the broad opening and so we are fine!\n\nSo finally we could just imagine a spherical object, mounted on a\nspindle, with spiral arc-like bumps at different places on the surfaces.\nWithin the arc-like bumps are funnel-like structures that create\ndifferentials in pressure when subject to the wind, and that creates\nrotation. Since the funnels are asymmetric by nature, our final rotation\nis unidirectional. Whew! ( Yes, that \"whew\" is also very suggestive here\n😃!)\n\n## Using TRIZ Separation Principles\n\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**\nparameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*\nfor example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*.\n\nOur IFR states that we want the rotor to yield one way and to not yield\nwhen pushed the other way so it needs to be both hard and soft at the\nsame time. This is a Physical Contradiction! In this case we can easily\nsee and application of [**Separation in Space**]{.smallcaps} and also\n[**Separation on Condition**.]{.smallcaps} However I think in this case,\nit would not be easy to arrive at the Solution using just these.\n\nThat's a wrap! In the next episode of the *#TRIZ Chronicles*, I wish to\nstep even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think\nlooking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler's\nbook,\n[**Maverick**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994 \"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994\")\nwould be a good idea!\n\n## References\n\n1.
