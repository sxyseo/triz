The earlier editions\nare here: [**Lawrence of Arabia**](../10-Lawrence-of-Arabia/index.qmd), \n[**Spotify**](../20-Spotify/index.en.qmd),\n[**Great Bubble Barrier**](../50-BubbleBarrier/index.qmd),\nand the [**OWind Turbine**](../40-Owind/index.qmd).\n\nThis is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative\nThinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*,\nover the past 8 years or more at the [**Srishti Manipal Institute of\nArt, Design, and\nTechnology**](https://www.srishtimanipalinstitute.in/ \"https://www.srishtimanipalinstitute.in/\") in Bangalore, INDIA.\n\n## {{< iconify maki road-accident >}} Where did the Bear cross the Road?\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/1Odg5sqjM-M >}}\n\nWildlife roadkill was a serious problem in [Banff National\nPark](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff) in Canada, for both\nwildlife and motorists. The problem was tackled beautifully by Parks\nCanada using a system of tunnels and stunning natural-looking overpasses.\n\nWithout further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable set of\ninventions.\n\n## {{< iconify pajamas issue-type-test-case >}} A TRIZ Analysis of the Banff Wildlife Crossings\n\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as\n[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ \"https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/\"):\n\n-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k \"Open Source TRIZ on YouTube\")**,**\n    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation\n-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /\n    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.\n-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and\n    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive\n    Principles.\n-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nHere below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify the\n*Parameters* of this Problem:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them\noff and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up\nseveral problem statements. Let us state some of our Problems\n\n1.  *Signage* would help drivers *slow down*, but slowing down may make\n    journey less enjoyable.\n2.  *Slowing Down* may improve *animal movement* but may endanger\n    humans.\n3.  *Clearing the Vegetation* may make animals more *visible*, but may\n    also make *vehicles* visible to animals and affect their movement\n\nAs you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our\nattention. Let us cut to the chase and state our [**Administrative\nContradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp \"https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp\")\nin *plain English*:\n\n::: callout-note\n## {{< iconify icon-park-outline reverse-operation-out >}} Administrative Contradiction\n\n**AC**: We wish to drive at high speeds, but not kill migrating wild\nanimals nor endanger our vehicles.\n:::\n\nWhat would an IFR be in this situation? How \"unreasonable\" can we be?\nLet us try:\n\n::: callout-important\n## {{< iconify cib ideal >}} Ideal Final Result\n\nThe Animals and Humans should both use the Road whenever they want\nwithout being mutually affected!\n:::\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,\nkeeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in\nthe [**TRIZ Contradiction\nMatrix**](../../materials/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which\nParameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what\nwe can obtain. We will analyze the Contradictions both ways[^1]:\n\n::: callout-note\n## {{< iconify icon-park reverse-operation-out >}} Technical Contradictions\n\n-   **TC1**: Improve `Loss of Time(26)` and not worsen\n    `Duration of Action by Moving Object(12)`\n:::\n\nSince our IFR is all about **time**, we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters\nthat are **time-oriented**. We could have also tried the following:\n\n-   **TC2**: Improve `Volume of Moving Object(7)` and not worsen\n    `Loss of Time(26)`\n-   **TC3**: Improve `Other harmful factors Acting on the System(40)`\n    and not worsen `Duration of Action by Stationary Object(13)`[^2]\\\n-   These include *Volume* and *External Factors* which are not quite\n    there in out IFR. Is there a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^3]\n    possible here?\n\n::: callout-warning\n## {{< iconify icon-park-solid reverse-operation-out >}} Physical Contradiction\n\nIn fact our IFR is nearly worded as a PC: The Vehicles and the Animals\nmust use the Road **at the Same Time**.\n:::\n\n## {{< iconify game-icons multiple-targets >}} Solving the Technical Contradictions\n\nLet us take the set of TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at\nthe list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix suggests:\n\nFor `TC1`:\n\n1.  3(Local Quality)\n2.  17(**Another Dimension**)\n3.  28(Mechanics Substitution)\n4.  8(Anti-Weight); and\n5.  19(Periodic Action),\n6.  10(Preliminary Action)\n\nHmm...based on the PC, we may have expected a **Separation in Space**\nsolution, suggested by *Another Dimension* and *Local Quality.* Viewing\nthese Inventive Principles as we [*Generalized\nSolutions*]{.underline}*,* we try to map these back into the Problem at\nhand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ\nembodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics,\ngeography, and biology.\n\n1.  **3(Local Quality):** So something that is local...local where?\n    Well, along the highway, of course. So something that is located a\n    specific points along the highway. Nice but not really clear enough\n    to be actionable, yet.\n\n2.  **17(Another Dimension)**: Well, well. The Road is a linear thing\n    and has length and breadth. What would we use for *another dimension*?\n    Height, of course! So, we need to go either above the\n    road or below! And that leads us to a ...bridge and a tunnel !!!\n\nThe other Inventive Principles are, to me, not evocative enough in this instance. But we already have a decent idea: we could just imagine a **set** of **Local** bridges and tunnels that occur at **Periodic** Intervals along the highway. And that is exactly what Parks Canada have done. \n\n![](https://discoverapega.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AB-BAN-2014-05.jpg)\n\nHere is the solution in action:\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/9JX6cqME6Hw >}}\n\n## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 parameter >}} Using TRIZ Separation Principles\n\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**\nparameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*\nfor example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*. Our IFR states that we want the humans and animals to use the road at the same TIME, and hence **Separation in Space** becomes a nice way to think of a solution. \n\nThat's a wrap! In the next episode of the *#TRIZ Chronicles*, I wish to\nstep even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think\nlooking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler's\nbook, [**Maverick**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994 \"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994\") would be a good idea!\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} Readings\n\n1.  <https://discoverapega.ca/stories/wildlife-crossings-key-to-highway-safety-in-banff/>\n2.

If we\n    can, then there are a very crisp set of **TRIZ Separation\n    Principles** that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n",
