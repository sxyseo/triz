Brainstorming is utter BS. Post-Its are a great Invention, but a complete waste of time*.\n\nThis is a [(very opinionated)]{.black .bg-gold} Contextual Enquiry Course on [Creative Problem Solving]{.black .bg-gold}, designed for\nthe Foundation (freshman) year of a Bachelor's Degree in Art and Design, at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore, India. (It is occasionally offered as a General Studies Course for senior undergraduate Art and Design Students). \n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Unit takes students on a journey of understanding the process of\nPersonal Creativity and Structured Innovation.\n\nWe begin by using the idea of Flow, as a pathway between ever-increasing\n(creative) Complexity and Boredom as defined by Csikszentmihalyi.\nChildhood Games will be examined to understand the aspects of Play and\nlinked to and the idea of \"Infinite Games\" by James Carse and how\nRule-Breaking in Play is an important step in enhancing personal\ncreativity.\n\nBourdieu's concept of Cultural Capital will be interpreted as one of the\nprimary sources for an individual's ideas, along with Csikzentmihalyi's\nidea of the Creative Domain, Field and the Creative Individual. Tools\nfor enhancing Cultural Capital will be introduced. The MBTI / Big 5 Tool\nwill be used to understanding ourselves, our abilities, strengths,\ntraits and differences from others.\n\nStructured heuristic techniques based on de Bono's 6 Hat method will\nhelp us see how to perform Situational Analysis and Idea Generation, to\nhelp us take ideas from conception to execution. Reference will be made\nto Alex Osborn's \"Applied Imagination\" methods and tied to the Big 5\nresults.\n\nAspects of the Systematic Russian Process of innovation and problem\nsolving, ***TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskhikh Zadatch)***\ninvented by Genrikh Altshuller will be introduced. Alshuller's idea of\nGeneralized Problem Solving by borrowing ideas/memes from other Domains,\nhis 8 Laws of Evolution of Products, and ( a few of ) the 40 Inventive\nPrinciples derived from his analysis of patents, will be covered in\ngamified fashion. These will be linked to with David Perkin's (Harvard\nProject Zero) ideas and Edward de Bono's methods to interpret, and\ndesign for, existing situations and products.\n\nAdvanced aspects of TRIZ such as Su-Field Analysis, the Laws of Product\nEvolution, and ARIZ will be introduced in gamefied fashion.\n\nField visits to product, food preparation, solar energy, and logistics\ncompanies will be used to bolster and demonstrate the unity of these\nconcepts acquired in class. Technological assignments, and non-tech\nmaking and presenting tasks will also be used in class to create\ngamefied experiences for all of these.\n\nThe students will finally use the methods and ideas they have learnt and\napply them in creating a project, artifact or performance of their own.\n\n## Course Contents\n\nThe course will have some basic foundations from psychological and\ncognitive science foundations, on top of which will be built the edifice\nof <u>[Big Understandings, Dispostions, and\nSkills](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/slides/fspmanifesto)</u>.\n\n-   Fundamentals of [Flow and Play]{.black .bg-gold}  as defined by Mihaly\n    Csikszentmihalyi\n-   Thinking Styles and how one appreciates the Problem Situation\n-   [Cultural Capital]{.black .bg-gold}  as a source of one's Ideas\n-   Genes and [Memes]{.black .bg-gold} \n-   Cognitive Biases and Functional Fixedness\n-   Cultivating a Mentality of Resource(fulness)\n-   Metaphors as Gateways\n-   [The Six Thinking Hats Method]{.black .bg-gold}  and how to apply them\n    in practice\n-   Innovative Problems Solving Methods like [TRIZ]{.black .bg-gold} , its\n    philosophy, and techniques such as the [TRIZ Contradiction\n    Matrix]{.black .bg-gold}  and [40 Inventive Principles]{.black .bg-gold}\n-   Advanced TRIZ methods such as [Substance-Field\n    Analysis]{.black .bg-gold} , [76 Scientific Principles]{.black .bg-gold} , and the [Laws of Product Evolution]{.black .bg-gold} \n-   Analysis of Hollywood Movies for manifestations of metaphoric\n    problems and TRIZ methods\n-   ***Bring your own Problem***: A Final Culminating Problem-Solving\n    Project\n\n### Why all this \"Structure\" to a course on Creativity?\n\nIsn't [Empathy Mapping-Brainstorming-Ideation-Iteration-Test]{.black .bg-gold}  the core of the Design process? What is this new(?)-fangled structured TRIZ process thing?\n\nLet us see some short extracts from Herbert Simon's landmark book,\n**Sciences of the Artificial**: (emphasis everywhere in the following is\nmine)\n\n> Chapter 5: *The Science of Design: Creating the Artificial*\n> Historically and traditionally, it has been the task of the science\n> disciplines to teach about **natural things**: how they are and how\n> they work. It has been the task of engineering schools to teach about\n> **artificial things**: how to make artifacts that have desired\n> properties and how to design.\n\n> Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs\n> who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations\n> into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material\n> artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes\n> remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan\n> for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so\n> construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the\n> principal mark that **distinguishes the professions from the\n> sciences**. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of\n> architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all\n> centrally concerned with the process of design.\n\n> In view of the key role of design in professional activity, it is\n> ironic that in this century the natural sciences almost drove the\n> sciences of the artificial from professional school curricula, a\n> development that peaked about two or three decades after the Second\n> World War. Engineering schools gradually became schools of physics and\n> mathematics; medical school became schools of biological science;\n> business schools became schools of finite mathematics.\n\n> Such a universal phenomenon must have had a basic cause. It did have a\n> very obvious one. As professional schools, including the independent\n> engineering schools, were more and more absorbed into the general cul-\n> ture of the university, they hankered after academic respectability.\n\n> ***In terms of the prevailing norms, academic respectability calls for\n> subject matter that is intellectually tough, analytic, formalizable,\n> and teachable***.\n\n> ***In the past much, if not most, of what we knew about design and\n> about the artificial sciences was intellectually soft, intuitive,\n> informal, and cookbooky***.\n\nYeah. That's why this course exists. To make Design tough, analytic,\nformalizable, and ~~teachable~~ learnable.\n\n## References\n\n1.  Herbert A. Simon.
