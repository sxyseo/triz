## TRIZ: A Workflow Review : 1

- Find a "Problem Situation", using say 5W + H. 

- Use the Ishikawa Diagram to finds **Knobs** and their **Parameters**

- Formulate a **ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC)** 
  - a trade-off or a compromise) in "plain English using the method of manipulation of the **Knobs**

 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 
 - Convert/metaphorize the **AC** into a **TECHNICAL CONTRADICTION(TC)** using **48 TRIZ PARAMETER**s


---
## TRIZ: A Workflow Review : 2

- Look up the **CONTRADICTION MATRIX**.  

- Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply

- *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it. Use your **CC**, and available **Resources**!

- If possible formulate a **PHYSICAL CONTRADICTION(PC)** from your AC. 
  - E.g Something has to be hot and cold at the same time
  - Use **SEPARATION PRINCIPLES** to solve the **PC**
  - Use of **SEPARATION PRINCIPLES** may not involve much *un-metaphorization*, but applying them may be easier!!
  - But getting to a PC may not be easy.

- If not solved, use **SUBSTANCE FIELD ANALYSIS** models

# Let us start with a couple of TRIZ stories!
## Then we jump in with detailed Case Studies!

.fancy[Alice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one can’t believe impossible things.”

“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”]

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #1: Meat Transportation

.pull-left[
A meat plant in South America ships its product to the US. Refrigeration is required during transport to keep the meat frozen. The meat is flown to the US, so refrigeration systems were installed in cargo planes. When competition increased, the owner of the plant sought to reduce delivery cost. 

It became obvious that he must increase the amount of product per air shipment. Analysis of the situation revealed that he could compete better if **the weight of the refrigeration system were replaced with that of meat**. 


]
.pull-right[
He did exactly that. 

Flying at an altitude of 15,000–25,000 feet the air temperature is below 32 deg. F, so no refrigeration system was actually needed. 

Conclusion: **Utilization of existing resources** costing nothing brought the system closer to Ideality. 

The art of inventing is the ability to remove barriers to Ideality in order to qualitatively improve a technical system.

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #2: Red Adair and Oil Well Fires

.pull-left[An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
The result was a blazing inferno. Famed firefighter Red Adair was called in. Red knew that the fire could be put out if a huge amount of fire retardant foam could be dumped on the base of the well. 

There was enough foam available at the site to do the job. However, there was no hose large  enough to put all the foam on the fire fast enough. 

The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough to do any good. 
]

.pull-right[However, Red Adair knew just what to do. He stationed
men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, and the Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee.

## TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #2
### Wildlife Crossings Key to Highway Safety in Banff

.pull-left[
Why did the bear cross the Trans-Canada Highway?

We may never know, but thanks to the Banff Wildlife Crossings Project, there’s a good chance it made it to the other side.

]
.pull-right[
When the 82-kilometre section of the Trans-Canada Highway that runs through the Rocky Mountains in Banff National Park was built in the early 1950s, it wasn’t expected to be the major artery it is today. 

But as park visitation increased, traffic volume surged—and so did highway-related wildlife mortality.

- **AC**: Ice accumulates on the metallic antenna and increases its weight, causing the light pole on which it is mounted to collapse. Since no one is around at the field site, this damage is discovered much later when someone arrives to take the antenna away. 

- **Knobs**: Mast? Antenna? Support? Ice? Wind?

- **IFR**: The Mast needs to be strong/heavy to support the antenna + ice, and be light to be carried away.

- Could the mast be made up of composite materials that are stronger and lighter?

- Porous Material? Maybe using a honeycomb structure, we could make the mast both strong and light at the same time

- Still: these are big changes in the design!!

- What *Intermediary* could we use? And where? We have only wind and ice...

- Can ICE be our intermediary? But it is what is coating our antenna!! .bg-washed-red[That's our problem thing!!]

- Oh...the MAST ALSO could get coated with ICE

- ICE makes the Mast stronger and supports it just when we need!!!

- We can .bg-light-blue[make the mast *rough*, or with surface bumps] to ensure it takes on more ICE
- The "bumps" need to be not along the length or breadth but outward along the .bg-light-green[width] of the pipe!

A ***ha-ha*** (French: hâ-hâ [a a] or saut de loup [so də lu]), also known as a **sunk fence, blind fence, ditch and fence, deer wall, or foss**, is a *recessed* landscape design element that creates a **vertical barrier** (particularly on one side) while preserving an **uninterrupted view** of the landscape beyond from the other side. 

The name comes from viewers' surprise when seeing the construction.
