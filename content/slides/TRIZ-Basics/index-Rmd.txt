## TRIZ: A Quick Workflow

 - Find a **PROBLEM**
 - Formulate a **CONTRADICTION** (a trade-off or a compromise)
 
 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 
 - Convert/metaphorize the **CONTRADICTION** into **TRIZ PARAMETER**s
 
 - Look up the **CONTRADICTION MATRIX**
 
 - Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply
 
 - *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it
 
 Now let us look at these steps in pictorial detail 🖼


---

## TRIZ Workflow: Formulate a Problem Description
.pull-left[
- Use your [**CULTURAL CAPITAL**](https://culturallearningalliance.org.uk/what-is-cultural-capital/) and your **DOMAINs** to write a PROBLEM in simple English
- Ask: **5W+H**
  - **What** does the problem seem to be?
  - **Who** has the problem?  
  - **When** does the problem occur? All the time? Under certain circumstances? 
  - **Where** does the problem occur? 
  - **Why** does the problem occur?(.small.orange["Ask why 5 times" -- W. Edwards Deming])
          - **How** does the problem occur?

## TRIZ Workflow: Look the "Resources" and Causes
.pull-left[
To refine our Problem, what Resources do we have?
- One Good way to do this is using the **Ishikawa Diagram**
- Man, Material, Method, Management, Machinery (Ishikawa)
  - This diagram is used **primarily** to assign **CAUSES**
  - But it conveniently lists all the **Resources**.
  - What things create the compromise/tradeoff?

## TRIZ Workflow: Inspect the Ishikawa Diagram

.pull-left[
- From the Ishikawa Diagram
  - What is **One Parameter or Knob** for each of the **Causes** that you have listed therein?
- Let us make a list for each Knob/Object:
  - What is the **Knob** meant to do? What is its main Purpose?
  - What are the other Accompanying Objects that it works with?
  ]
.pull-right[
- What are the **current Settings** for each Knob?
- Change the Setting of Each Knob to its **natural opposite extreme**. What Happens?
  - You will see that in many cases, each Knob creates a Certain Outcome at one Setting and another Outcome at the Opposite Setting.
- This is the Source of your Administrative Contradiction !!
]  
What sort of Contradictions do we see in these familiar objects? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?

## TRIZ Workflow: Example - Develop an AC
.pull-left[

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/milk-boiling-over-a-pan-picture-id493478270?b=1&k=20&m=493478270&s=170667a&w=0&h=bbo4MJZQ787snRo9DUKysp6CEIhCWlJyCjp7W0Zi3ek=")

```
]

.pull-right[
- Use the **Ishikawa Diagram** to Refine the AC
- Again use your **Cultural Capital** and **Domains**
  - *Watching the Milk is a Bore!!Can I do something else in the meantime?*
  - *But: the Milk will boil over...*
- **AC**: 
    - **I can either boil Milk, OR do something else, NOT both.**

- Use the Ishikawa Diagram:
 - Man: Me?
- Method : 
  - Operating the Stove
  - Wanting/Doing Two Things at the Same Time
- Material: Milk, Vessel, Stove, Gas, Time, Heat
  - Milk boils over when it is heated
]

- *Watching the Milk is a Bore!! Can I do something else in the meantime? But, the Milk will boil over...*

#### TRIZ Workflow: Example - State the AC

## TRIZ Workflow: Specify the Ideal Final Result (IFR)

.pull-left[
- State an **Ideal Final Result**
- A basic principle of TRIZ is that systems evolve towards increased **ideality**, where ideality is defined as

$$Ideality = Benefits / (Harm + Costs)$$
- **Evolution** is in the direction of
 - ⬆ Increasing benefits
 - ⬇ Decreasing costs
 - ⬇ Decreasing harm
- IFR allows us to **invert the direction of the problem**: to come backwards from Solution towards the Situation
]

.pull-right[

The ***extreme result*** of this evolution is the Ideal Final Result:
 - It has all the benefits,  
 - none of the harm, and
 - none of the costs of the original problem.
 - The Ideal Final Result describes the solution to a technical problem, **independent of the mechanism or constraints of the original problem**. 
 - It occupies no space, has no weight, requires no labour, requires no maintenance. 
 
]
---
class: center, middle

#### TRIZ Workflow: Example - State the IFR

.fancy.large.blue[IFR: The Milk must "boil itself" and wait for me without overflowing.]

Any other <u>*even more unreasonable*</u> way of saying this?

---

#### TRIZ Workflow: Example - State the TC(s)

- Choose from the 48 TRIZ Parameters to "metaphorize" your AC, into a TC.
  - Milk: 21-Stability? ~~10-Amount of Substance?~~ 25-Loss of Substance?
  - Stove: 27-Loss of Energy? 17-Energy Usage by Stationary Object
  - Me: 26-Loss of Time?

There can be more than one TC that you can set up !!

- TC #1: Improve **21-Stability** of Milk - without worsening **17-Energy Usage by Stationary Object** 

- TC #2: Improve **25-Loss of Substance** of Milk - without worsening **26-Loss of Time**

---

- TC #1: 21-Stability of Milk without worsening 17-Energy Usage by Stationary Object

## TRIZ Workflow: Use the Contradiction Matrix

.leftcol30[
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/boiling-pan-mini-case.png")
```
]

.rightcol70[
  - One Worsening Parameter: **17: Energy Usage by Stationary Object** (Stove is ON !!)
  - One Parameter to Improve: **21: Stability** ( Milk must NOT boil over !!)
  
- **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** from the Matrix: 

.leftcol45.small[
- 35: Parameter Change
- 18: Mechanical Vibration
- 24: Intermediary
- 9: Prior Counteraction
- 3: The Other Way Around

.rightcol45.small[
- 35: Parameter Change

Also we can use two vessels, one inside the other. The inner one with milk and the other one with water!

**A Milk Watcher Device**
- This is dropped into the vessel before pouring the milk
- It vibrates when the milk is boiling and prevents spillage
- And of course, there is a patent. Yes , in Russia, where else !!

## TRIZ Workflow: IP-35: Parameter Change
.pull-left[

- What "Parameter" can we change?  
    - Temperature?
    
    - Rate of Gas?
    
    - Kind of metal used in Vessel?
    
    - Smoothness of the Vessel finish?
]

.pull-right[
Here are some solutions using Parameter Change
- Sprinkle Water on the Froth...Umm

- **Apply butter to the rim of the vessel beforehand !!**
- This is also a solution derivable from **IP-9: Prior Counter Action**

## TRIZ Workflow: IP - 13: The Other Way Around
What do you think?

- Cold Milk poured into an already hot vessel? Wild...

- How about the Two Vessel Trick, from earlier: one inside the other. The inner one with milk and the other one with water! Can the Water be hot before hand?

- Not all IPs may strike you as applicable! 

- Try and leverage somebody's else's **Cultural Capital** !!
