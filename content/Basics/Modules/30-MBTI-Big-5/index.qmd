## Introduction

Socrates said, "Gnothi seauton"(Γνῶθι σαυτόν), *know thyself*. Let us do that, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.

### Icebreaker Game!

Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:

-   *Silently* work through the slide until you have found all the numbers\
-   Raise your hand when you have done so.

### A Personality Game

I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:

-   Discuss how to complete the Task\
-   Complete the Task and document your work\
-   *Also* document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.\
-   Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team

## Why does this Matter to Us

- In the Icebreaker Game, some of you would have difficulty trying to spot the pattern WITHOUT discussing with your friends!
- Others would have perhaps frowned at the slightest whisper in the class, as they were concentrating!

- In the Team Game, you might have realized that each of the 4 teams had members that were different in ONE of the MBTI characteristics! So I had pitted `I vs E people`; `N vs S people`; `T vs F people`, and `J vs P people`. The tasks allocated to each of you was precisely one to make that *dichotomy* surface in your discussions. And of course, the documentation of the discussions was far more important than the end results !! ;-D

So what have learnt then? From the two exercises, we see that:  

  - Reality depends upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view. Note that this is about our *cognitive bias* that may depend upon our cultural outlook, and our ability to miss things. 
  - It is emphatically not about <u>[alternative facts](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/alternative-facts/)</u> which is arrant nonsense.
  - We all have our "default modes" for behaviour, that give us a restricted appreciation of the World
  - As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better. 
  - Comprehending reality better gives a stronger basis for Art/Design **decisions** and plans for action.
