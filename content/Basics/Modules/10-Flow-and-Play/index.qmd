Play!! Yes, you.

## Discussion #1: Play

How did you play?

-   Did you get bored?
-   Did you lose sense of time at any point?
-   Did anything become too difficult at any time?
-   What did you do at such times?

Let us quickly review the [four central ideas in Play by Robert Caillois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Play_and_Games).

## What is Flow?

```

We will understand **Flow** from:

1.  The book the book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, titled [**Flow: The Psychology of Happiness**](Flow_%20The%20Psychology%20of%20Happiness%20-%20Csikszentmihalyi,%20Mihaly.pdf). First, let us learn to say his name!!

`r embedr::embed_audio("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Mih%C3%A1ly_Cs%C3%ADkszentmih%C3%A1lyi.ogg")` 


  Let us read the relevant pages (pp. 72-76, *Flow Activities*). This section nicely juxtaposes Csikszentmihalyi's ideas of `Flow` and Caillois ideas of `Play`, and states, as a finding of their research, that:

  >....every flow activity, whether it involved competition, chance, or any other dimension of experience, had this in common: It provided a sense of discovery, a creative feeling of transporting the person into a new reality. It pushed the person to higher levels of performance, and led to previously undreamed-of states of consciousness. In short, it transformed the self by making it more complex.

## Discussion #2

-   Is the idea of Flow elusive? Is it similar to Play? 
-   Do only some people get it, and then only at some times?
-   Was David Foster Wallace's talk somewhat self-deluding?
-   Then what is this *Empathy* stuff we talk about when we speak of Design Thinking?


## Pop "Quinx": Want still more Flow?

No, that is not a bad spelling....why not? Go find me in this picture !! <br>

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusions

- Flow is a `Zone of Play` between the rising `Floor of Boredom` and the approaching `Ceiling of Anxiety / Challenge` ( my "definition"!)
- You need to use the Boredom to push away the Ceiling to stay in Play
- To do that, you may need to:
  - Break Rules: Change how you experience / perceive things
  - Understand your Assumptions: ( More on this later)
  - Use and Create Surprises: Spot the Problem lurking in your Boredom
  - Grow More Skills to handle higher Complexity


## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Flow is a great state to be in when you are working
- It enables you to experience your work, your problem solving, in a way that is unique and hyper productive
- And...
- If you build / design some thing, wouldn't you want flow for the people who use that thing?
- Flow is your gift to your users / customers / clients / audience !!
- And so, it is both a beginning, and an end in Design!!
