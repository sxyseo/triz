## Parallel Thinking

Edward de Bono invented the concept and phrase, "Parallel Thinking" in his book with the same title. Let us understand what this is:

## Propositions

Now that we have an idea of about Parallel Thinking, let us get into it! Let us consider a couple of ideas for schemes that have been "around" for some time:

- Military Conscription for 2 years
- Children Manage the House for one week
- Young People must be assigned one Elderly Person to live with
- All Cars must be removed from the City Centre

Can we apply Parallel Thinking to these and come up with a vote, or even a way to achieve these, if we can agree with the Propositions?
