## Introduction
```{r}
#| label: nothing
#| include: false

```
I have used my Readwise (<https://readwise.io>) highlights to create a set of Games that can bring the experience of TRIZ Principles into the classroom. These games are designed to be engaging and educational, allowing participants to explore TRIZ concepts in a hands-on manner. They lean on my highlights about forms enabling creativity and clear goals in play ([forms as engines of creativity](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018165/?highlight=418453120), [clear goals each step](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=497152462)), and use head-fake learning via games ([indirect learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2017765/?highlight=545366404)).

### GAME 1: Resource Hunt Sprint

Goal: Train eyes for available resources (fields, substances, structures, time, space).

Round 1: 

   1) Give a simple `Object` system and a harm, preferably a picture.: (e.g., paper airplane: wing angle, weight, nose stiffness; or a website button: size, color, copy). 
   2) Teams list all internal/external resources in 3 minutes, then propose which of the resources listed are `controllable` or `uncontrollable`.

Why: Reinforces fundamentals before “fancy stuff” [get fundamentals down](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2017765/?highlight=310844306) and encourages breadth first [produce many ideas](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=574963219), [many different ideas](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=497152467).

Output: Put the Resources down in an Ishikawa Diagram.

Round 2: Repeat with a more complex `Situation`

### GAME 2: Turn the Knobs (Contradiction Discovery)

Goal: To surface a TRIZ adminstrative/technical/physical contradiction by “turning the knobs,” stating it accurately via rapid A/B experiments using DOE basics.

Setup: 

   - Pick the simple `Object` system with tunable “knobs” / resources that are `controllable`
   - Define two outcome metrics/situations that tend to move in opposite directions when knobs are changed (e.g., speed vs. stability; conversion vs. time-on-page). 

Round 1: 

1) Teams vary one knob at a time across extremes (turn-to-max-and-min). Observe how Metric A improves while Metric B degrades, forcing a TRIZ-style contradiction statement: “We need X high and X low simultaneously.” 
   - ⁠Quick A/B test design with goal/metric ([A/B to optimize](https://readwise.io/bookreview/12341321/?highlight=260298073)).
   - ⁠DOE mini: vary 2 factors at low/high (2^2), measure outcome ([factorials](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11437011/?highlight=293327732); [DOE principles](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11437011/?highlight=293324518)).
   - Confounding variable, if found, can lead to TRIZ Physical Contradiction
   - The note linking confounders to a “Physical Contradiction in TRIZ” fits well here ([Art of Statistics](https://readwise.io/bookreview/12341321/?highlight=260307553)).
   - This mirrors how confounders and splits can reverse associations, as in the note on contradictions and [Simpson’s paradox](https://readwise.io/bookreview/12341321/?highlight=260307830).

2) Teams articulate the contradiction clearly.
3) Obtain a max of 3 Contradictions.

Round 2: Repeat with a more complex `Situation`

### GAME 3: Contradiction Duel / Auction (Engineering contradictions)

#### Cards:

   A. TRIZ Parameter Cards (49 parameters (print multiple))
   B. Contradiction Prompts

   - ⁠Improve X but worsens Y. Name X, Y in your problem.
   - ⁠Physical contradiction: need hot and cold; large and small; fast and slow. Identify your pair.
   - ⁠Hidden confounder: two metrics move together because of Z. Find Z ([confounding insight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/12341321/?highlight=260307553)). A confounding parameter is often like a TRIZ Physical Contradiction.(PC)

   
1) Each Team gets randomly picked 4 Cards containing TRIZ Parameters. 
2) Each team proposes two Technical Contradictions (A vs. B) that embody the Contradiction, using these 4 Parameters.
3) Each Team has to make the metaphors apparent to others.
4) The `most surprising` Technical Contradiction wins the auction!
5) Bonus for finding the Confounding Factor Z!

One-page rules:

   - ⁠Players: 3–6. Time: 20–30 min.
   - ⁠Setup: Each team gets two challenges from the previous round.
   - ⁠Play: 3 rounds x 5 minutes. Draw 3 Principle cards per round. Generate at least 1 idea per card for each challenge.
   - ⁠Scoring: Each round, teams star their best idea; swap with neighbors for peer “field” validation per my creativity notes ([gatekeepers/field](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=738946144)). Peers award 0–2 points for novelty/usefulness. Use `Fluency`, `Flexibility`, `Elaboration`. Highest total wins.
   - ⁠Debrief: Note surprises and how you surprised others ([surprise diaries](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=341698525)).

Round 1: A/B to Probe the Space

4) Split Teams into 2: Randomize who tests A or B first; collect outcomes quickly. 
5) Multiple teams can work on A and on B respectively for replication. This mirrors web A/B practices with rapid iteration and large-N sensitivity in principle ([A/B testing overview](https://readwise.io/bookreview/12341321/?highlight=260298073)) and uses DOE fundamentals like `randomization` and `replication` ([DOE principles](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11437011/?highlight=293324518)).


Facilitation tips:

- Force crisp hypotheses before testing to avoid post hoc stories, aligning with conjectures-and-refutations discipline ([Popper via Taleb](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2017652/?highlight=303505216)).
- Keep tests short, playful, and disciplined—creativity plus rigor ([playfulness and discipline](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=401381388)).
- Encourage phrasing alternatives as questions to reduce defensiveness during design debates ([phrase alternatives as questions](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2017765/?highlight=283022312)).

### GAME 3: 20Q to Random Forests for TRIZ Patterns

Cards

   - ⁠Target Deck: 20 common product/service problems (e.g., “Fragile device in transit,” “Slow onboarding”).
   - ⁠Question Cards (blank): Players write yes/no questions that partition possibilities, inspired by TRIZ categories (materials, time, control, intermediaries, separation).
   - ⁠Insight Cards:
   
      - “Change dimension”
      - “Intermediary”
      - “Preliminary action”
      - “Self-service”
      - “Parameter change”
(each nudges question design)

Rules

   - ⁠Players: 3–6. Time: 20 min.
   - ⁠One chooser draws a Target, others ask up to 20 yes/no questions to identify the problem type. After reveal, each player proposes 1 TRIZ-inspired fix from their Insight card. Link to my 20Q-as-decision-tree highlight ([20Q ~ decision trees](https://readwise.io/bookreview/12341321/?highlight=264773179)).
   - ⁠Score: Guessing team 1 point for identify; +1 if at least one fix earns peer upvote for feasibility.
   - ⁠Debrief patterns found across rounds.

### GAME 5: Blessing-in-Disguise Hack

Cards:

⁠“Waste” Deck: latency, heat, noise, byproduct, queue, scrap, error logs, failed sessions.
   
⁠Converts Deck:

  - Energy harvesting
  - Signaling/telemetry
  - Secondary market
  - Catalyst/seed
  - User delight
  - Training data
  
Rules:

   - ⁠Draw 1 Waste + 2 Converts; pitch how the harm becomes resource ([blessing in disguise](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=497152462)). 2-minute turns; peers vote novelty/usefulness.

Printing layout tips

   - ⁠Card size: 3.5 x 2.5 in (Poker) or 2.75 x 4.25 in (bridge). 8 per page fits Letter/A4. Use duplex short-edge flip.
   - ⁠Color codes by set for easy sorting; keep plain-style text for teaching clarity ([plain style for teaching](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018165/?highlight=315555820)).
   - ⁠Add “round goals” on card bottoms for clear stepwise flow ([clear goals](https://readwise.io/bookreview/2018256/?highlight=497152462)).
