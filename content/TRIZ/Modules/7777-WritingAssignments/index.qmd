## Reading and Writing Assignments

1. [I am Water](../../../Basics/Modules/10-Flow-and-Play/index.qmd):
   - Read  Chapter 2, titled *Classification of Games*, from Roger Caillois' book ***Man, Play, and Games***. <https://annas-archive.org/md5/b367135626629104fffa66c32d91defb>
   - Think of several everyday experiences that you might have several times during the course of a week, e.g. Cooking, Cleaning, Doing Groceries, Reading, Listening to Music, Singing, Exercising, Commuting...
   - Describe one or more instances of such life experiences where you **experienced** each of `agon`, `alea`, `mimicry`, and `ilinx`
   - Did you **modify** such an experience, by infusing it with any of these elements? (e.g. mapping an *exhausted letter* in [Antakshari](https://greengroundsports.com/know-about-antakshari-game-and-how-to-prepare-play-it/) to a relatively unused one, to make the game more challenging and interesting)
   - What were your realizations on such experiences and/or their modification?
   - What can you create with that Modification? A product, a service, a game, or a piece of art?
   
1. [I yam What I yam](../../../Basics/Modules/20-Cultural-Capital/index.qmd):
   - Re-read carefully the article from class, *What is Cultural Capital?*. <https://culturallearningalliance.org.uk/what-is-cultural-capital>
   - Think of a Life Experience where you were completely dumb-founded, you could simply comprehend what (almost) everybody was doing or choosing to do. Think ceremony, dress, gesture, behaviour, choice of word or phrase ( "think different". Bah.) 
   - What might have been the *cultural grounding* that you embody, that might have prevented you from (at least initially) comprehending?
   - How might you, in retrospect, modify your *grounding* to arrive at a better, and more rapid, understanding of what happened?
   - Is that same aspect of *grounding*, or similar, likely to affect you in the future?
   
1. [Bird of Different Feathers](../../../Basics/Modules/30-MBTI-Big-5/index.qmd):
To be Written Up.
1. [I Connect therefore I am](../../../Basics/Modules/35-Domain-Field-Self/index.qmd):
    - Pick up Barbara Ann Kipfer's **Flip Dictionary**, or any other dictionary
    - Randomly find a few ***Adjectives*** ( e.g. acerbic, diabolic, enchanting, ballistic, incendiary, colonial, motionless...)
    - Randomly find a few ***Abstract Nouns***) ( e.g. mechanics, solitude, marketing, friendship, justice, ecology, ...)
    - Again randomly, combine *one adjective with one abstract noun*.
    - Does the combination make sense, as a `domain` of work? Would the new `domain` have a language? What might a few words be that could be included in this domain-specific language? ( e.g. "forensic art" could, just, mean a science where one looks at paintings and find out precisely the historical period, season, time of year, and the phase of the moon on the day they were painted in, by examining minute details of brush strokes, pigments used, canvas weave, etc. Words in this domain might include: pigment analysis, canvas weave, brush stroke morphology, etc. )
    - Make as many combinations as you can, and make `domains + languages` out of them
    - Bonus points if you can ***name*** (with justification!) an expert from the `Field` that belongs with this new? `Domain`. (Expert can be a fictional figure too!)
    
1. [A Year of Metaphoric Thinking](../../../Basics/Modules/50-Metaphoric-Thinking/index.qmd)
   - Read one of the following (ha!):\
        - Joshua Ferris, **The Market Value of my Father**, a metaphorical Short Story. [(Web Link)](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/joshua-ferris)
        - Primo Levi, **Carbon**, a metaphorical Short Story. [(PDF)](https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/periodic-primo.pdf)
   - List the Metaphors that are revealed in the work
   - Describe the *source domain* and the *target domain* for each metaphor you identify
   - Describe what **attribute** was carried forward from the *source domain* to the *target domain*
   - Comment, based on your own subjective experience ( aka CC ) whether and why each metaphor *worked for you* or not?

1. [Problems and Contradictions](../60-Problems-and-Contradictions/index.qmd)
   - Read the article, *What are Problems?*. <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pain-loss-and-suffering/202105/what-are-problems>
   - Trawl through your Insta / Locket / Snapchat / Discord / Twitter timelines ( or whatever you call them), or stand-Up comedy shows, or meme pages, or any other source of short-form social media content
   - Find **3 posts** or stories that especially funny or startling, or have people up in arms
   - Describe if there are two *pole positions* or *contradictory forces* at play in the post. (E.g. look at the Covid Healthcare vs Job Loss related Twitter post, and others, from class)
   - Describe how the posts uses these contradictions to create humour or surprise, or anger
   - Quote/Screenshot the Post ( or link to it if possible) in each case
   - Reflect on how you might use such contradictions
   - Create a ( Oh sweet God..) a reel, a post, or a story of your own
   - `Less than 3` if you can create a meme that becomes viral in class, including your (elderly) Teaching Faculty.
   
1. [TRIZ Resources](../70-TRIZ-Resources/index.qmd):

   - Watch any (number of) episodes of your favourite cartoon. Choose ones that have a lot of action / running around. (Spy vs Spy (especially!!), Tom and Jerry, Beep-beep the Roadrunner, the Beagle Boys ... would fit the bill).
   - Keep an eye on the kind of things / objects / situations that they make use of in their ploys
   - Describe these using the terminology of the metaphor that we have acquired.
   - If possible, draw the Ishikawa Diagram for each *ploy*: what does the (cartoon) character want to do, and how do they use available Resources to do it?
   - You may include materials that the characters, especially Wile. E. Coyote, may buy from [A Company that Makes Everything](https://fictionalcompanies.fandom.com/wiki/ACME)
