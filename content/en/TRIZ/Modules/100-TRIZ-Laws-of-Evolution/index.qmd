- Find Opportunities based on Radar Chart

## Laws of Product Evolution

- Law of completeness of the system: Systems derive from synthesis of separate parts into a functional system.
- Law of energy transfer in the system: Shaft, gears, magnetic fields, charged particles, which are the heart of many inventive problems.
- Law of increasing ideality: Function is created with minimum complexity, which can be considered a ratio of system usefulness to its harmful effects. The ideal system has the desired outputs with no harmful effects, i.e., no machine, just the function(s).
- Law of harmonization: Transferring energy more efficiently.
- Law of uneven development of parts: Not all parts evolve at the same pace. The least will limit the overall system
- Law of transition to a super system: Solution system becomes subsystem of larger system.
- Law of Transition from Macro to Micro: Using physically smaller solutions, e.g., electronic tubes to chips.
- Law of Increasing Substance-Field Involvement: Viewing and modeling systems as composed of two substances interacting through a field.

## How Would you Redesign this Product
TBD. Plot a set of Radar charts showing different stages of evolution of well known product lines. Obsolete products are even more interesting.
