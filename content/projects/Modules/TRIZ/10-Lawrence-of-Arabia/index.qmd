## Introduction

![](feature.jpg)

The movie *Lawrence of Arabia* is justly famous for its terrific story,
great cast of characters and actors, and some truly legendary scenes.
Here I take one of the iconic scenes from the movie, the attack on the
port town of Aqaba and interpret the entire event and the build up to it
from a **TRIZ** viewpoint.

I will give a short description of the movie plot first.

I then discuss the source of the problem, how it occurred to Lawrence,
and how he went about solving it in this dramatic fashion. I give an
analysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including
the formulation of the **Contradiction**, **Identification of Causes**,
the statement of the **Ideal Final Result**, and finally using the
**TRIZ Contradiction Matrix** to find **Inventive Principles** that
inform Lawrence's solution. I also dwell in passing upon aspects of how
this story can be interpreted as a manifestation of Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi's **Creativity Systems Model**.

This piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative Thinking and
Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*, over the past 8
years or more at the *Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and
Technology, Bangalore, India*. (<https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in>).

## Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary

The movie is the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who
successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes
during World War I in order to fight the Turks. The stellar cast
includes Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Ali, Alec Guinness as
Prince Feisal, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Claude Raines as Dryden,
and Anthony Quayle as Col. Brighton. The director was David Lean. The
editing of the film by Anne Coates is also much admired. (
<https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/tag/lawrence-of-arabia/> )

Lawrence is a complex, talented, and yet simple man, who is extremely
well read (Greek philosophy and the Koran, for example) and is also an
expert in Arab affairs and has considerable skill at map-making. Due to
his being interpreted as insolent and insubordinate , he is given a
lowly job at the HQ in Cairo. Dryden manages to convince the General
that Lawrence should be allowed to go into Arabia and to find out what
kind of long-term plans Prince Feisal is making for Arabia.

Here is the map of the events that are unfolding in the movie at this
time.[^1]

Lawrence encounters Ali in dramatic fashion at the Masturah Well, on the
way to meet Feisal, and his Arab guide is shot by Ali, a direct
experience for Lawrence of inter-tribe rivalry in Arabia. (Ali is a
Harith, and Tafas the guide was a Hashemi). Lawrence peremptorily
rejects an offer of help from Ali, and finds his way alone to Wadi
Safra, where Feisal is camped. He is met by Col. Brighton as he nears
the camp. Both enter camp just in time to witness another bombing raid
by Turkish airplanes.

Later in the meeting with Feisal, Brighton tries to convince Feisal to
retreat to Yenbo (Yanbu) and be out of range for the Turks, and where
the British Army would supply them, train them to fight against the
Turks. Feisal reluctantly accepts this plan, though he would rather the
British navy take the port city of Aqaba and supply his army from there.
Brighton simply scoffs at that idea, because *the Turkish have 12 inch
guns at Aqaba* and *the British have other things to do*.

Lawrence has already intrigued Feisal by completing a verse from the
Koran as it was being read by Selim, the cleric. At the end of the
meeting, Feisal confronts Lawrence alone, as to *his* intentions in
Arabia and finds out, to his astonishment, that Lawrence has his own
interpretation of what his tasks and loyalties were, and these did not
necessarily coincide with those of Brighton. In fact, Lawrence is *not*
in favour of the Arab Army's retreat to Yenbo, as *it would become one
small part of the British Army*. As a parting remark, Feisal says to
Lawrence that the Arabs *need what no man can provide, a miracle*.

Here is the video of that terrific tent meeting scene.

## Lawrence's Problem

Lawrence does not sleep that night. Provoked by Feisal's parting remark,
he sits up all night on a sand dune close to the camp, thinking about
how Aqaba could be taken, since he wants the Arabs to continue fighting
from where they were, and even advance if possible with British help.
His detailed understanding of the Arabian geography, his knowledge of
the Aqaba port and its fortifications, all come to the fore here. Aqaba
is a port at the head end of a narrow gulf to the east of the Sinai
Peninsula.

In the early morning, seemingly in a [eureka
moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect), he decides that
attacking Aqaba from the landward side would be a good solution, since
the guns there could not be turned around.

Here is Lawrence trying to convince Ali about this plan:

</center>

Lawrence does not inform Brighton of his plans, nor even Feisal. It is
Ali who informs Feisal of this enterprise. Clearly, Lawrence does not
consider Brighton as a member of his *Field* (as defined by
Csikszentmihalyi in his [Creativity Systems
Model](https://medium.com/call4/domain-8a22b6b486f4)), but Feisal is a
Field Member to Ali.

Apropos, the act of sitting up all night can be seen as the Incubation
and Elaboration stages of the [5 Stages of
Creativity](https://pearce.caah.clemson.edu/the-5-step-creative-process/)
from Csikszentmihalyi (Preparation, Incubation, Insight, Elaboration,
Execution).

## A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba

For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as follows:

First, using the method described in *Open Source TRIZ*,
(<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k>), we identify *knobs* or
*parameters* within the situation and see how turning these could lead
to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a **Contradiction**.

Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* for this purpose:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Cause and Effect Diagram or Fish- bone Sample
library(qcc)
library(SixSigma)

#Effect
effect <- "Cannot take Aqaba"

#Causes
causes.head <- c("Measurement", "Material", "Methods", "Environment", "Manpower", "Machines")

#Individual Causes
causes <- vector(mode =  "list", length = length(causes.head))
causes[1] <- list(c("Guns point at the Sea",  ""))

causes[2] <- list(c("Big Guns at Aqaba", "Small Arms Only", "Water", "Sand"))

causes[3] <- list(c("Attack from Sea won't work", "Time of Attack", " No Element of Surprise"))

causes[4] <- list(c("Nefud Desert","Narrow Gulf"))

causes[5] <- list(c("Small Army", "No Tribal Unity"))
causes[6] <- list(c("No Vehicles", "Loss of Warships"))

#Fishbone Diagram
#
ss.ceDiag(effect,causes.head,causes, 
          main ="The Taking of Aqaba",
 # ss.col = c("#666666", 
 #            "#BBBBBB", 
 #            "#CCCCCC", 
 #            "#DDDDDD", 
 #            "#EEEEEE", 
 #            "white", # Background
 #            "red"), # Headings and Main Title
          sub = "Ishikawa Cause-Effect Diagram\n(made with R packages SixSigma and qcc)")



```

Turning the *knobs/parameters* in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if
the British allies attack Aqaba, they may win, BUT they may lose a few
warships. If the Arabs want to attack, they are too small in number and
have no warships, and hence their chances of success are very slim.
Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an
[**Administrative
Contradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp) in
*plain English*:

::: callout-note
## Administrative Contradictions
**AC**: The Arabs need the British to supply them via Aqaba port. Aqaba has huge guns and they will sink the British ships in that narrow gulf if they try a naval attack. So the Arabs need to take Aqaba without losing British ships.
:::


Next, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa
Diagram above, we are now ready to define the *Ideal Final Result*:

::: callout-note
## Ideal Final Result
**IFR**: The Arabs need to attack and take Aqaba port, and the big guns there should have no effect.
:::

Note how the tone of this IFR is like a "eat my cake and have it too".
Very typical for IFRs, this impossible-sounding tone!

Let us take the AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*.
We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in the [*TRIZ Contradiction
Matrix* **(PDF)**](../../materials/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see
which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is
what we can attempt, stating the Contradiction both ways[^2]:

::: callout-note
## Technical Contradictions
**- TC 1**: Increase `Duration of Action of a Moving Object` (12) and not worsen `Stability of Objects Composition` (21)\

**- TC 2**: Increase `Stability of Objects Composition` (21) and not worsen `Duration of Action of a Moving Object` (12)
:::


Here we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that the guns at Aqaba
should not affect the Arab attack at all. The Parameters chosen from the
TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as **metaphors** for the knobs that lie
within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of *making
metaphors*. We could easily have chosen the Parameter `Power(18)` or
`Illumination Intensity(23)` to "metaphorize" the effectiveness of the
attack, if our imaginations run in that direction. There is here a
considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations
of the AC, but using the **language of TRIZ**.

We could even stretch to making a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^3]
happen:

::: callout-note
## Physical Contradictions
**PC**: The Ships must be near the guns but not be near enough to be shot at. (They must be near and not near at the same time)
:::


## Solving the Technical Contradiction

Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution
for TC-1 in the figure below:

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.height="125%", out.width="125%"}

knitr::include_graphics("matrix.png")

```

The Inventive Principles are:(TC1)

1.  IP 13 (The Other Way Around)\
2.  IP 35 (Parameter Change)\
3.  IP 24 (Intermediary)\
4.  IP 40 (Composite Materials)

and (TC2)

5.  IP 10 (Preliminary Action)\
6.  IP 5 (Merging)
7.  ~~IP 35 (Parameter Change)~~\
8.  ~~IP 13 (The Other Way Around)~~

How are we to apply these Inventive Principles? Here again is an
imaginative exercise as we map these **Generalized Solutions** back into
the Problem at hand:

-   **IP 13: The Other Way Around**. Change the Direction? Of what? Two
    aspects have "direction" as attributes: the attack, and the guns,
    which Lawrence can't control. So how does he use this? Not attack by
    sea? Wait...**ATTACK BY LAND**!! Change the **DIRECTION** of Attack!
    So attack from the other side, the land side!! (We could
    retrospectively add this parameter to the Ishikawa Diagram too).
    Will this work? Yes, the guns can't turn around!!

-   **IP 35: Parameter Change**. But "ships" on land?? Note, *the desert
    is an ocean into which no oar is dipped*. Sand and Water are both
    **Resources** in the problem, as we have duly noted in the Ishikawa
    Diagram. So a different kind of ocean and therefore a different kind
    of ship? At a stretch, we can say the warships of the British Navy
    are being substituted with the use of ....Camels!! And,
    metaphorically speaking, it is *still* an attack using ships....*The
    Ships of the Desert*!! So water becomes sand, and the warships
    become camels using Parameter Change !

-   **IP 10: Prior Action**. How? Lawrence and Ali are far from Aqaba
    and cannot do anything "in advance". What could this be?

-   **IP 5: Merging**. However, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence and Ali
    must **recruit the Howeitat tribe "in advance" of their attack** !!
    As Lawrence tells Ali, *If 50 men came out of the Nefud Desert, they
    might be 50 men other men would join*. This is in accordance with
    what IP 10 is suggesting, to get other tribes to join in, *in
    advance* of the attack.

-   **IP 40: Composite Materials**. What object within the situation can
    we reconstitute with smaller pieces of different types? The British
    Army...so an army made up of pieces? Yes! The Tribes need to unite
    into one *composite* army.\
    And, instead of large warships, the Arabs switch to a *composite*
    force with camels...

So IP 13 works nicely now, along with IP 35 and IP 40, to give us a
*camel-borne attack from the landward side*. IP 10 also teams up with IP
40 and IP 5 to give the idea of *tribe unification*.

And so Lawrence and Ali, with the help of Auda Abu Tayi, attack Aqaba
port from the landward side by crossing the Nefud desert on camels, and
take it! And we have justified their decision using TRIZ !!

Here is the final solution in action !!

<br> I hope that was as much fun to read as it was for me to write it up
!!

## Points to Ponder

-   Do we each of us need a Dryden to vouch for us and help us get
    access to the Field?
-   Does TRIZ work in both mundane and industrial contexts? (Yes of
    course!)
-   Can we just take the 40 Inventive Principles directly and throw them
    at every Problem, without necessarily going through the process of
    creating Contradictions and IFR? Hipple's book has a remark in this
    direction.
