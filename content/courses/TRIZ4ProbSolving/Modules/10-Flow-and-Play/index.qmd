Play!! Yes, you.

## Discussion #1

-   Did you get bored?
-   Did you lose sense of time at any point?
-   Did anything become too difficult at any time?
-   What did you do at such times?

## What is Flow?

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Flow.png")
```

We will understand **Flow** from:

1.  The book **Flow and the Psychology of Happiness**, pp; 72-76; by
    **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**. First, let us learn to say his name!!

Here is the
<u>[book.](Flow_%20The%20Psychology%20of%20Happiness%20-%20Csikszentmihalyi,%20Mihaly.pdf)</u>

1.  This video: {{< youtube 8h6IMYRoCZw >}}

<br>

2.  This TED Talk : [**Flow, the Secret to
    Happiness**](%22https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare%22)
    {{< youtube fXIeFJCqsPs >}}

<br> 3. This is Water: David Foster Wallace's famous Talk:
{{< youtube eC7xzavzEKY >}} <br> 4. Let us quickly read and discuss this
extract from the **Play and Playground Encyclopedia**
<https://www.pgpedia.com/m/man-play-and-games>

## Discussion #2

-   Is the idea of Flow elusive?
-   Do only some people get it, and then only at some times?
-   Was David Foster Wallace's talk somewhat self-deluding?
-   Then what is this *Empathy* stuff we talk about when we speak of
    Design Thinking?

## Pop Quix: Want still more Flow?

No, that is not a bad spelling....why not?

Go find me in this picture !! <br>

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusions

- Flow is a `Zone of Play` between the rising `Floor of Boredom` and the approaching `Ceiling of Anxiety / Challenge`
- You need to use the Boredom to push away the Ceiling to stay in Play
- To do that, you may need to:
  - Break Rules: Change how you experience things
  - Understand your Assumptions: ( More on this later)
  - Use and Create Surprises: Spot the Problem lurking in your Boredom


## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Flow is a great state to be in when you are working
- It enables you to experience your work, your problem solving, in a way that is unique and hyper productive
- And...
- If you build / design some thing, wouldn't you want flow for the people who use that thing?
- Flow is your gift to your users / customers / clients / audience !!
- And so, it is both a beginning, and an end in Design!!
