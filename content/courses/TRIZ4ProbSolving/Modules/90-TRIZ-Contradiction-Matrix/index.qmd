# Introduction

In the previous Module on **Problems and Contradictions** we understood how to identify a **Technical Contradiction** in everyday situations. This is the first and most important step in the TRIZ Problem Solving Method. 

Next we look at two methods to **Resolve Contradictions**:

- Using the **Contradiction Matrix** and **Inventive Principles** for **Technical Contradictions (TC)**

- Using TRIZ **Separation Principles** for **Physical Contradictions (PC)**

## Discussion

- The <u>[TRIZ Contradiction Matrix](pdf/TRIZ/matrix2003.pdf)</u> gives us 3-4 short, pithy **metaphoric solutions**, called **TRIZ Inventive Principles** that are eminently suited to our problem.\

- We need to look at those Inventive Principle metaphors, and translate them back into our problem. Think of this process as, what else, yet another metaphor: *taking the antilogarithm* to arrive at the solution of a complicated multiplication problem. \
- We use our CC, that we have embedded in the Ishikawa Diagram, to decide which knobs we can turn in accordance with each Inventive Principle. 


Here is an example from the movie <u>[Home Alone(2)](https://youtu.be/mz-snPWBQYQ)</u>:

{{< youtube h_bUcNjmuSk >}}
<br>

The use of the movie **audio dialogue** by Kevin could be an example of the following *TRIZ Inventive Principles*:\

- `Taking Out` ( i.e. taking the essential good/bad part out of something)\
- `Continuity of Useful Action` (i.e. repeated use of a good solution)


## A TRIZ Workflow

We have seen  

- How to examine a Situation  
- Use the Ishikawa Diagram to find Knobs and Settings
- Find one or more Administrative Contradictions  
- State the Ideal Final Result  
- Convert the AC into a TC with 39 TRIZ Parameters  
- (Convert the AC into a PC)  

Now we will use the TC and find out solutions for it using what is called the **Contradiction Matrix**. Here is a workflow presentation below:
